 A Journey of Joy




CHAPTER I

OUR WAY ACROSS THE SEA


It was the close of a gusty day in late November when two persons sat
watching the early dusk close down upon the outside world. A long
line of light still lingered behind the purple hills upon which there
stood out a few houses silhouetted against the primrose yellow of the
sky. Within the nearer confines of the lawn the leafless trees looked
dim and shadowy. The whirl of eddying leaves against the wall sounded
ghostly, and the rattling of the vines against the side of the house
suggested wintriness.

“And in Italy,” murmured the elder of the two women, “it will be all
sunshine and light.”

“Italy?” There was a question in her companion’s voice.

“Yes, I am going there.”

“Alone? You surely are not going alone.”

“No, Sidney is going with me.”

“Sidney? Oh, I am jealous,” the girl responded petulantly. “As if it
were not enough that Sidney has a grandfather with lashings of money,
a beautiful home, a devoted brother, an indulgent mother, while I am a
poverty-stricken wretch whose blessed little mother must turn and twist
and contrive to make both ends meet;--as if all this were not enough
but you, my own godmother, who is mine by birthright, must be spirited
away from me for a mess of pottage,--for pottage read spaghetti; that’s
what they live on in Italy, I believe,--and I must sit and smile during
the process of spiriting.”

“But Gabriella, dear, Sidney is also my goddaughter.”

“Yes, worse luck; I always did hate her for it.”

“Gabriella! you do no such thing. You are devoted to Sidney.”

“I might be if she were not so aggressively well off.”

“She is the least aggressive person I know. You rarely find a more
simple-hearted girl.”

“Clothe her in hand-me-downs, and she might be, but exaggerated wealth
stands out in her tailor-made gowns and her hats.”

“That is where you err; the tailor-made gowns do not add one iota to
her figure, and the hats are never becoming.”

Gabriella did not heed the interruption. “And in her furs and feathers
and jewelry--”

“Which she never wears obtrusively. She will display no jewels on our
travels, I can assure you. Don’t be cantankerous, Gabriella.”

“Oh, I must be. I always have had a grudge against Sidney since the
day we were christened at the same font and she behaved so beautifully
while I yelled like sin. Even then I must have had a foreknowledge of
what our relative positions in life would be.”

“You are the silliest child, Gabriella.”

“But in spite of that fact you love me, don’t you, Gem?”

“Of course I do, and that is why I am going to take you abroad with me.”

“Dearest Gem, is this a make-believe such as you are so fond of getting
up at this charmed hour, or have you suddenly fallen heir to a fortune,
or what? Please explain yourself. When you speak in that assured manner
of taking me to Europe I feel myself getting weak in the knees.”

Miss Cavendish laughed. “Will you positively go with me, Gabriella?”

“Will a duck swim? Oh, Gem of purest ray serene, do tell me what you
are driving at. Speak seriously as one who would not trifle with sacred
things. Please don’t be frivolous where such a subject is concerned.
Sidney as Sidney is bad enough, but Sidney and you and Europe; I cannot
endure the combination.”

Miss Cavendish leaned back in her chair and fixed her eyes upon the
distant hills, now an irregular line against the fast-fading primrose
yellow. “You know, Gabriella,” she began, “I have been thinking for
a long time of going to Europe, but I didn’t want to go alone and
I didn’t want to go with a casual companion. A dozen friends and
acquaintances have proposed my joining some special party, but, my
dear, there is no undertaking in life, except marriage, which involves
such nicety of choice as the selection of a travelling companion. One
is too fussy, another too delicate, a third interested in exactly the
opposite things to those which interest you, still another cannot
endure _pensions_ but insists upon hotels, or perhaps is nothing
of a pedestrian but must take a carriage everywhere, and so on. I
never realized how many objections could arise till I gave careful
consideration to the merits and demerits of my various acquaintances.
So the more I thought the matter over the more I felt inclined to
venture alone with Sidney, if she would go, and you, if you could be
persuaded to leave your native land.”

“Persuaded!” ejaculated Gabriella under her breath.

“So then,” Miss Cavendish continued, “although I know but little
French, less German and no Italian, I am not afraid to personally
conduct our small party. I believe we could travel more cheaply than
if we were to join a company of regulation tourists; certainly we
could be more independent, and the opportunity for adventure would
be unlimited. When I broached my plan to Sidney,--you know I spent
Thanksgiving with the Shaws,--she was most enthusiastic, and though I
made certain stipulations, she agreed to everything and is in a state
of great excitement over the prospect. Since her mother has never
felt that there was a time that she could leave old Mr. Shaw, Sidney
has yet to take her first trip abroad. Mrs. Shaw declares she would
not willingly trust her with anyone but me, and Sidney has agreed to
travel in my way, that is in a very economical manner which involves no
superfluous expenditures, unless they be of a purely personal nature.
So, you see, my dear, we shall all be on exactly the same footing.”

“Rather nice of Sid to agree to that, considering what she has to
spend. But I don’t yet see my place in this scheme of things.”

“You will see,” Miss Cavendish went on. “I have been looking up
travelling rates and _pensions_ and Baedekers, so, with this, that
and the other, I know pretty well what can be done, and I believe a
thousand dollars will cover our expenses for six months and give us a
very good time.”

“A thousand dollars apiece, you mean?”

“No, a thousand dollars for the two of us. It will be cheaper for two
to travel together than for one, and cheaper still for three. I don’t
suppose that amount will buy us many Paris gowns or much Brussels
lace, but I am pretty sure it will cover all but the luxuries. Now, I
have the thousand dollars which I have set aside for this trip, and I
shall be much happier if I can take both my goddaughters with me. Will
you go?”

“But dearest, it seems perfectly sinful to spend all that money on me.
Are you sure you ought to do it?”

“I’m very sure that I’d rather stay over there six months with you
and Sidney than to go by myself, and I am also sure that I would much
prefer your society to that of a party of strangers whose doxies
might not be my doxies. When I mentioned your going to Sidney she
was delighted. She spoke much more sweetly of you than you of her,
though she does envy you your ready wit, your looks and your general
adaptability.”

“I’ll sell them all for her ducats.”

“Because you know you can’t.”

“Sidney is a dear; I always loved her.”

“A moment ago you always hated her.”

“That was because I saw everything being poured into her lap. Now that
I am to share her good times I love her. I love everybody. I love
everything to the meanest worm that crawls. I never knew before what a
broadly charitable spirit I possessed. It is a beautiful world and I
well know that the loveliest spot in the universe is Italy. When do you
think of sailing, Gem, dear?”

“About the middle of March.”

“And what shall I need?”

“I intend to take only such clothing as shall be necessary for three
months travel through Italy and Switzerland. This can all be stowed
away in a small hand trunk which will not have to be registered as we
can carry it from place to place without having it put in the baggage
car, or the luggage van, as they will call it. It can be toted across
platforms by a porter who will put it in the rack over our heads and
there it will be in plain sight all the way. One steamer trunk will do
for the two of us; it can be stored, and be sent to us when we need it
for our return trip. When we get to Paris, if fripperies so possess
our souls that we need room for them, we can easily buy a light wicker
trunk. I must confess to indulging in an anticipation of doing that
very thing.”

“How delightful it all sounds,” said Gabriella, hugging her knees.
“Are you sure it is not a make-believe; one of those lovely twilight
dreams you always have been so fond of summoning for my entertainment,
especially when I used to call you Auntie Belle, and before I
discovered that you were a true gem. What a happy discovery it was when
I grew so big that to call a woman fifteen years my senior, godmother
seemed ridiculous, and I cut it down to G. M., which to my delight
one day resolved itself into Gem. It is the nicest name in the world
and just suits you, for if ever there were a gem it is you, dearest
Isabella Cavendish, Auntie Belle, godmother, Gem. What a dear you have
been to me ever since I got red in the face and doubled up my fists as
if to fight the world, the flesh and the devil bodily, while I howled
lustily in the arms of dear little Belle Cavendish, who had made my
christening robe and who held me tight in spite of my squirmings and
battlings with my mottled pink fists. Oh, I can see it all. I can see
us later, too, when I was a witch of three, you a dainty young lady of
eighteen, who used to take me to see good little Sidney Shaw. I can
remember climbing all over you and weeping on your silken shoulder
because Sidney would not let me wash her face. I can remember the
hoodlum at eight, too, when I came to your house and slid down the
haircloth cushions of the sofa till cushions and I came to the floor
together and I knocked out a tooth which for days I had refused to have
drawn though it fairly waggled with looseness. I can remember how dear
you were to me that day; in fact there are days all along when you have
pulled me out of difficulties and have stablished my goings, and now
comes the crowning act of all. If I tried to thank you in the right way
I couldn’t do it. All my thanks are inside, but they choke me when I
try to say them.”

“Don’t try to say them, then. Suppose we light up and look over that
pile of folders and plans on my desk. I purpose sailing by way of the
Mediterranean directly to Naples. It will not be so cold nor so rough
as the northern route.”

“Spring in Italy! Oh, goddess mother, you are indeed a fairy godmother.”

Miss Cavendish laughed. “What a contradiction of terms. If you lose
your wits at this early stage of the proceedings, what will you do when
we are really landed at Naples?”

“Oh, it sounds so delicious. I am actually cold and shivery. Just wait
a minute till I get my breath before we tackle that dear delightful
Baedeker. How familiar it will be before we are through with it. Ah,
I am glad I have not outlived my enthusiasms. Usually it is so much
easier to dream than to do, but now the doing will exceed the joy of
the dreaming.”




CHAPTER II

“UNDER THE WALLS OF PARADISE”


By the first of April Gabriella had viewed from the steamer’s deck
her first walled town, that once famous city named for the Berber
sheikh, Tarif Ibn Malek. The picturesque group of houses clustered in
the curve of the strait, so situated as to command the entrance to
the Mediterranean, was doubtless a piratical stronghold which made
the most of its position in those old days and allowed few vessels
to pass in free. This forerunner of the modern bugbear, customs, no
doubt was quite as much, if not more, dreaded. It has its own history,
has Tarifa. It has seen the fierce struggle between Christianity and
Mohammedanism, and was witness in later battles to England’s effort to
snatch Spain from the clutches of Napoleon.

“It would be a place well worth visiting,” said Miss Cavendish as
Tarifa vanished from view and the dim outline of Africa’s shores seemed
to melt into that of the Spanish coast. “I shall go there some day,”
she added half to herself.

Then Gibraltar loomed up against so spectacular a sunset sky that, as
Gabriella said, it seemed almost too stagey. “Only Nature herself
would dare to use such splashes of color, such indescribable reds and
pinks and yellows.” At last the glory faded into grey and the fleecy
clouds huddled down on the mountain tops, like a flock of sheep going
to rest for the night.

“You’ve been wanting a sensation,” said Miss Cavendish, “and I am sure
nothing could be more thrilling than our first sight of Gibraltar; that
mighty rock with that gorgeous sunset behind it. I, for one, shall not
forget it while I live.”

“Nor I,” Gabriella hastened to say, “but I am truly glad that you did
not say that frowning rock; it would have spoiled my sensations.”

“To think that we are in the Mediterranean and that yonder is Spain,”
remarked Sidney; “it is very exciting.”

“Still,” returned Gabriella, “you can’t say it has been an eventful
trip. This is our first excitement and we have been ten days out; not
an iceberg, not an accident of any kind, not even a storm.”

“For which Heaven be thanked,” ejaculated Miss Cavendish fervently.

If Gabriella wanted excitement she had it before the next morning,
for at an early hour the passengers were roused by a sudden jar, a
sound of scraping along the side of the steamer, then there was the
terrifying silence, which follows when the familiar throbbing of
the engines ceases to be felt. Next there was a sound of running
footsteps overhead, of dragging ropes and clanging bells. Gabriella
made a tumultuous descent from her berth and hurried to the porthole.
“What is it? What is the matter?” cried Miss Cavendish. “I must call
Sidney.” She hurried into her dressing-gown and rushed to the adjoining
stateroom which Sidney occupied. She found the girl gazing out of the
porthole, with apparently no apprehensive fears.

“Isn’t it beautiful?” she said in response to Miss Cavendish’s touch
upon her arm. “Just look out, Gem, and see how perfectly exquisite it
is.”

“Dear me, I thought I should find you scared to death,” said Miss
Cavendish. “Is there really nothing wrong, Sidney?”

“No, I can’t discover that there is. Just see that sky and that little
ship and all.”

Miss Cavendish looked out upon a scene of wonderful beauty. Overhead
where the sky was deeply blue, a waning moon swam like a galley with
prow high in air. In the east there was a faint flush of dawn rosily
pink toward the horizon, while midway toward the zenith a great silver
star cast its beams upon the deep blue waters below. At a little
distance from the steamer lay a white sailing vessel like a wounded
bird. From the fact that a small boat was hastily making its way toward
it, the passengers gathered that something had happened to the sailing
vessel and a closer examination showed that the bowsprit was gone and
a gaping hole was visible. Miss Cavendish returned to Gabriella. “There
is nothing very much the matter,” the latter assured her. “I think we
must have run down that poor little schooner. She seems quite helpless.
Look, Gem, at the rows of heads poking out of the port-holes for all
the world like turtles from their shells. I’ve been conversing with our
next-door neighbor, and he told me what was the matter. It was great
fun to watch them lower the boat. The captain and second officer went
off in it to the little vessel. I hope no one was hurt.”

Later developments proved that no one was hurt, but that the vessel was
disabled and must be towed back to port. “You wanted excitement and
you had it,” said Sidney to Gabriella, “and now we shall be a whole
day late in getting into port, though I must say I don’t care much. I
wouldn’t have missed that exquisite dawn for anything, besides all day
we shall have those beautiful snow-capped mountains to look at.”

“To say nothing of the thrill we received when we thought something
serious had happened. I shall never forget my sensation when the
engines stopped; it seemed the deadliest silence I ever experienced. I
wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”

“You would be singing another tune,” said Miss Cavendish, “if you were
adrift in a life-boat on this fickle Mediterranean.”

“But so long as I am not, I can rejoice at the adventure,” returned
Gabriella, “for now we shall see Malaga, and I am dying to step on
Spanish soil. Do you suppose they will allow us to land?”

However, though Malaga was the nearest port, the passengers did not see
it that day, for by noon the schooner had been transferred to the care
of a passing craft, and the travellers were again headed for Naples.
They were made aware of their approach very early one morning when one
of the steerage passengers rent the quiet of daybreak by a thrilling
cry of “Italia!” All his heart was in his voice. He had been watching
all night. Amid sunshine and flowers they landed, and were whirled to
their convent _pension_ through Naples’ picturesque streets.

“Naples may have few great buildings to display,” said Miss Cavendish,
looking around critically, “and oh, what a dirty place! but such
color, such motifs for pictures may well drive an artist wild. One can
forgive her filth that she covers up with flowers, and who would ask
for splendid architecture where there are streets like this?” She waved
her hand toward a thoroughfare which was a series of steps bordered on
each side by stalls crowded with masses of flowers. Overhead, on lines
stretched across, dangled garments of many hues, scarlet cloths hung
from the window-sills; the windows themselves were often screened by
yellow or red awnings; balconies displayed pots or growing plants and
trailing vines; up and down the street groups of persons or single
individuals passed and repassed in constant procession; all was color,
glow, sunshine; a picture framed between the soft greyish white walls
of the tall houses which cast deep shadows only to make the sunlight
seem brighter.

“I was afraid the approach to Naples would be the most satisfying
picture she could present to us,” said Miss Cavendish, “but I am not
disappointed with this inland scene.”

“I suppose it displays an appalling amount of inexperience and crass
ignorance to be so surprised and pleased,” said Sidney, “but when it
is one’s first trip abroad one has a right to be enthusiastic, don’t
you think? I have no doubt some of our friends would find this anything
but stimulating, ‘so hackneyed’ they would say, ‘Why not find something
more unfamiliar to rave over?’”

“Oh, but I was under the impression that we came because it was new
to us, and I, for one, do not intend to act like a disillusioned
globe-trotter who has drunk her travelling-glass to the dregs. This is
to be a journey of joy to us who have not outgrown our enthusiasms,
and anything that contributes in the least to our pleasure is to be
welcomed, be it old or new, well known or discovered on the instant. I
believe in seeing the in-the-way places first, and the out-of-the-way
ones another time.” Gabriella spoke decidedly.

“That is the true spirit, Gabriella,” Miss Cavendish told her. “We are
to be a law unto ourselves, and we shall have the privilege of enjoying
whatsoever pleases us and not what custom and habit declare the tourist
should enjoy.”

“Then perceive me enjoying,” returned Gabriella. “For once I am
devoutly thankful that I am not lapped in luxury, else I might be a
peevish complainer because I could not get the best room in the newest
hotel or because the service wasn’t perfect or some such fool thing as
that. During this trip I intend that my halo shall always fit.”

“The guide-books give mention to a couple of dozen churches,” said
Sidney, who had been studying her Baedeker with some diligence. “Which
are we to see, Gem? Not all, I suppose.”

“No, we shall not have time. The cathedral, Santa Chiara, San Domenico
Maggiore, and San Lorenzo are all that I think we shall want to see;
I am told they are the best. We shall go to the National Museum, of
course.”

“And to the Aquarium, of course.”

“Then we must not forget the fine views around Naples.”

“That from the Capo di Posilipo I am bound we shall not omit,” said
Miss Cavendish, “and I do want to go as far as Pozzuoli; in that
direction is a store of antiquities, and one is on classic ground.”

This was all accomplished within the next three days and then Miss
Cavendish announced that she thought they were ready to leave Naples.
“But I love it. I don’t want to leave it,” complained Gabriella.

“Not even to see the Blue Grotto, Sorrento and Pompeii?” asked Miss
Cavendish, smiling.

“I am nearly consumed with excitement now,” declared Gabriella,
“but when you mention those places I feel myself in such a state of
ebullition that I shall evaporate into steam if I don’t look out. I
have this morning beheld a goat walk upstairs to be milked, and have
seen the descent made in the most matter-of-fact way, as if the dear,
funny little creature reasoned it all out. No doubt it knows its
customers as well as if it were a human. I have also viewed a woman
arranging her hair, and performing such scanty ablutions as she deemed
necessary; all this right on the street in the eyes of all who chose to
behold. Then I saw scores of artisans at work at their various trades,
and nearly the whole family life going on in the face of the public;
cooking, washing, sewing, spanking babies, feeding them, dressing
them, though the last didn’t need to delay long. Truly the people of
Naples live in the streets. One thing makes me indignant, and that is
the way the poor little donkeys are treated. They are such patient,
meek-looking little creatures and have such heavy burdens to bear;
they are beaten unmercifully, too; yet, I am told they are taken every
year to be blessed by the priests. I think the greatest blessing that
could be bestowed upon them would be a fund given to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and a law that would establish a
legal weight for them to carry and that would cause the government to
beat their beaters.”

“Perhaps, now that Gabriella has had her say,” remarked Sidney, “she
will allow Gem to declare our plans for the next move.”

“I thought we would best go to Capri and Sorrento next,” Miss Cavendish
hastened to say. “I learn that if you go to the quay you can get
tickets at a reduced rate, for there is sharp competition and one may
sometimes get a ticket as low as two francs for the round trip to
Sorrento and Capri. One must be sure not to accept tickets for the
larger boats, for it is on the smaller one that we find the cheap
rates. We shall go to Capri and Sorrento the same day, stay over
night at Sorrento, drive to Amalfi, remain there over night, drive to
Salerno, and take the train from there to Paestum. Then, if we choose,
we can go on from there to Pompeii or we can come back to Naples and
take Pompeii as a separate trip.”

“Might as well do it all at once,” advised Gabriella. “Let us pack up
and sally forth. I am wild to get out again into these heavenly streets
and see all I can of these angelically dirty people; they are so dear
and picturesque, and seem so happy living out-of-doors, pursuing their
little trades right on the sidewalk in such a sociable way. If I were
an artist I should drop down here in Naples and stay. I might wander
as far as Capri or Sorrento, but I should never want to go any further.”

“I suppose we ought not to take up our precious time in going to the
Aquarium again,” remarked Sidney, “but I should like to see that
dreadful octopus again. He is positively fascinating. While Gabriella
likes the streets, I like the Aquarium; it is as mysterious as an
under-world with that half light and that marvellous collection of
‘things forked and horny and soft’ that ‘lean out from the hollow
sphere of the sea.’ It most be a wonderfully attractive place to the
naturalist.”

“There, I can’t pass that old blind man again,” Gabriella suddenly
said. “Every time we go by this corner I see him out of the tail of my
eye, and now he is getting into my system. I’ll just have to go back
and buy a box of his matches. We’ll probably need them in the next few
days. You needn’t wait for me; I’ll follow on.”

“We might stop and get some oranges,” suggested Sidney to Miss
Cavendish. “I saw a beautiful branch in one of these little shops just
ahead.” She made her purchase, which she triumphantly displayed to
Gabriella when she overtook them. “Seven, all on one branch and only
seven soldi, aren’t they fine? Did you get your matches?”

For answer Gabriella held out an open box in her hand. “I gave him ten
centesimi,” she told them, “and look.” The box was empty.

“The old fraud! I’d take them right back and demand a full box,” said
Sidney indignantly.

“I don’t believe there is a thing in any of them,” declared Gabriella,
“and if there were, how could I make the exchange without standing
there in the view of the populace and opening every one? What should I
say? I have no words for the occasion, I am sure. _Grazie_ doesn’t seem
appropriate, neither does _buon giorno_ or _quanto_ appear to cover
the need, and those are about all the words I know. Even if I took the
dictionary along with me I am sure it would not supply a conversation
upon just this particular subject. No, the incident is so funny and so
beggarly Italian that I shall keep my little box as a souvenir and am
perfectly willing to have paid ten centesimi for the experience. I am
wondering now if Gem will have any difficulty with her tickets. Suppose
they should be for some other point or should be last year’s issue and
of no use whatever.”

“It would be terrible,” said Miss Cavendish, aghast. “Still, I don’t
think they would dare to do a thing like that in cold blood, and I
surely can read the name of our destination. I know enough for that,
Gabriella.”

“I hope so,” said Gabriella, a trifle doubtfully, and looking at her
match-box.

But Miss Cavendish had not the slightest difficulty in selecting
the man with the cheapest tickets, and in assuring herself that they
were not bogus, and therefore they were presently aboard the little
steamer bound for Capri. “Now this is quite as comfortable as that
big pretentious steamer which laughs us to scorn,” declared Sidney.
“Moreover I am discovering that where cheapness is an object you often
find there are benefits thrown in. Here, for example, one sees the
people and not the tourists. Deliver me from those hordes of tourists
that throng the churches and trample on your heels in the galleries. I
am afraid the Blue Grotto will be full of them to-day; the water is so
perfectly smooth and lovely.”

“I am glad we thought to bring chocolate and biscuits and things,”
remarked Gabriella, “for if the horde, as Sidney calls it, should
happen to want all the food that Capri can furnish, we shall not want.
Where are your oranges, Sidney?”

Sidney turned around in dismay. “Why-- Oh dear, I must have left them
in that shop when we stopped to get the chocolate. Isn’t it a pity?”

“Oh, well, you can get some more at Capri,” Gabriella comforted her by
saying. “You had the pleasure of buying them, and that was the main
thing. Just think of it, our bodies, as well as our souls, to-day are
‘far away, sailing the Vesuvian bay.’ I don’t wonder that Buchanan Read
wrote ‘Drifting’ if he loved this place as well as I do, for I could
write a poem myself if I stayed here long enough.”

“But I’ve heard that he had never been to Italy when he wrote that,”
said Sidney.

“Really? It seems incredible, doesn’t it? Then that is where he and I
differ: he could write a poem about what he had not seen, and I could
write one only of what I had seen many, many times.

  “‘Here Ischia smiles o’er liquid miles,
    And yonder, bluest of the isles,
    Calm Capri waits--’”

“There, there, Gabriella,” interrupted Miss Cavendish, “we all know it
by heart and have been repeating it at intervals for the last three
days. Spare us when the reality is before us.”

“That is the very reason,” returned Gabriella; “when one is actually
‘under the walls of Paradise’ there is no use in trying to express
one’s self in anything but poetry.”

“In that case,” replied Miss Cavendish sarcastically, “one of us at
least would have to remain silent most of the time.”

“Cruel Gem,” murmured Gabriella.

“There are the little boats coming out to meet us,” cried Sidney. “We
must be near the grotto. I wish I could see the opening. Do you suppose
that tiny little hole in the cliffs can be it?”

“It would probably appear no larger from this distance,” Miss Cavendish
answered.

“I’m getting scared. I don’t believe I want to go.”

“Silly girl, why not?” asked Gabriella.

“Because I’ve heard tales of ladies being robbed by the boatmen, and of
getting in there and not being able to get out again for hours. I am
sure I should not like to remain in such a blue place all night.”

“You need have no fears to-day,” Miss Cavendish assured her. “In the
first place there will be dozens of boats going, to judge by the crowds
on the other steamboats, and again this is a perfect day; the water is
as smooth as glass and there will not be the least danger in our having
to stop in the grotto for more than a few minutes. So, come along.”

When they emerged, half an hour later, even Gabriella was pale. “It was
rather fearsome,” she declared. “What with all those boats knocking
against each other, with the cries of the boatmen, and the prospect of
being splashed by a big wave as you rode out, it wasn’t as funny as
I anticipated. I think, however, that we came off very well, for our
boatman was more careful than most.”

“It was wonderful, wonderful,” murmured Sidney. “I am glad I went. To
feel yourself surrounded by that wonderful pellucid blueness--”

“Blueness doesn’t describe it,” Gabriella interrupted, “it is too tame,
too commonplace. I should say _blueth_. It must have a word all to
itself, for it is like nothing else in the heavens above or the earth
beneath or the waters under the earth. Please adopt my word fresh from
the mint.”

“We will,” Miss Cavendish promised. “What an ideal day and how
fortunate that we brought our lunch, for there is such a crowd ready
to invade every café and restaurant that I doubt if we could be served
very speedily or comfortably.”

“It will be much more fun, too, to find some quaint little corner where
we can have our meal _al fresco_. There, I have arrived at the proper
spot for the proper use of that expression.”

“Hear them calling: Coralli! Coralli!” said Sidney as they took their
way up the steep road. “I must buy something. Capri is _the_ place for
corals.”

“I’ll get some, too, if I can find a string for fifty cents. I’ll
offer that for the best I see.” Gabriella cast her eyes critically
over the corals presented by the nearest vendor. “I am learning to Jew
down most successfully, and I shall try my hand at a real bargain this
time. See those lovely pale pink ones, Sidney. Do get those.” Which
Sidney promptly did, while Gabriella chaffered and haggled over a less
pretentious string, finally bearing it away in triumph. “What did I
tell you?” she exclaimed. “I knew I could get them for two and a half
francs if I kept a firm front, and they are not half bad.”

“They will look much better at home, too,” Miss Cavendish assured her.
“Everyone finds that out, and wishes he or she had not passed by so
many pretty, cheap trifles which seem so valuable to one’s friends at
home. Do see those children dancing the tarantella as if it were the
business of life. Did you ever see such a picture? I shall have to give
them some coppers.”

“And have them haunt you the rest of the day.”

“Never mind; we shall have the fun of seeing them dance,” said Sidney.
“Aren’t they the funniest little creatures? See them snap their fingers
and dance backward up this steep road.”

“Perhaps they can tell us where we can get some oranges,” said
Gabriella. “I confess to feeling a crying need for sustenance. Where is
the dictionary? What do you ask for? Aràncio? Melaràncio, or what?” She
put a halting question, and the children stopped their dance and stood
staring uncomprehendingly. But a man, passing, halted and beckoned to
the ladies, who followed him to a gate set in a high white wall by
the roadside. The man unlocked the gate and ushered them into a sort
of courtyard with stone seats on two sides. He politely motioned them
to the seats, went further up the hill and cut from one of his orange
trees a quantity of oranges which he brought to them. At the same time
he made it known to them in the few English words that he knew that
they were very welcome to eat their luncheon under his vine and fig
tree, literally. The little white house which opened into the courtyard
appeared cleaner than most. A woman with a baby in her arms and with
two or three children clinging to her skirts, peeped curiously from a
portico above. Two little boys, more venturesome, came from the house
to view the strangers, but they were quickly ordered out of sight and
the ladies were left in possession.

“Isn’t this perfect, and isn’t he a dear?” said Gabriella.

“And how much better off we are than those personally conducted who are
crowding the cafés and restaurants,” said Sidney, peeping over the wall.

“This is simply ideal. Here comes our dear man again. What has he now?”

Their host approached, dusty bottle in hand. “Would the signorinas be
pleased to have a bottle of Lacrima Christi? He could recommend it?”

“At least, that is what I gather from his remarks,” said Gabriella. “Of
course we want it. _Grazie! Mille grazie, signor._ Please to hear my
fluent Italian, Gem. I am getting on.”

Then glasses were brought and the wine was proffered to each. It proved
to be delicious and the three congratulated themselves upon the happy
chance that brought them to such a spot. They thanked their host as
profusely as their vocabulary would permit and received the assurance
that the padrone was pleased that he could give them of his best.
Would they not remain awhile and rest? they should not be disturbed.
He brought them fresh water and clean towels, removed the orange peels
and soiled glasses and left nothing undone which in any way would
contribute to their comfort. In broken Italian on the one side and
broken English on the other a conversation was maintained, but the good
will needed no words.

“We have intruded quite long enough,” declared Miss Cavendish at last.
“I wonder how much I should offer him.” She drew forth her purse;
the _contadino_ protested. She offered him coin; he refused it. Miss
Cavendish turned to the girls aghast. “He actually means us to accept
his hospitality for nothing. Did you ever? We can’t do that.”

But at this moment a solution to the difficulty appeared in the
person of a soft-eyed, dark-haired little girl bearing in her arms
a cherubic baby. “Your youngest?” Miss Cavendish asked the man. He
smiled joyously, showing his gleaming white teeth. “Then this for the
bambino,” said Miss Cavendish, putting a lira into each chubby hand,
and they departed amid _adieux_ and _grazies_ from the entire family
assembled to see them off.

“It was lovely, simply lovely,” said Miss Cavendish, “to discover such
disinterested hospitality in this day and generation. I can scarcely
believe that this grasping world possesses such a rarity as our
_contadino_.”

“You don’t suppose,” Sidney ventured hesitatingly, “that it was all
a pretence, and that the baby was brought in at the last moment for
effect? It seems too Arcadian to be real.”

“Why, my dear,” Miss Cavendish exclaimed. “Do you imagine that
travellers are in the habit of knocking at his gate for admission? Why
should they? I am sure no one would even know a house was there. He
just happened to overhear us when we inquired for oranges. He doesn’t
keep an inn, and I doubt if Americans ever entered his garden before. I
must retain my belief that it was real kindliness and not a matter of
loaves and fishes, else why did he refuse the money at first? We might
have gone away then and there, you know. Oh, no, it was unmistakable
generosity and true hospitality, and I think we shall see more of it
before we leave Italy.”




CHAPTER III

IN HONOR OF A QUEEN


Miss Cavendish was not disappointed in her optimistic belief in the
kindliness of the Italians, for after Sorrento was reached and the
three tired, but happy travellers had decided to quarter themselves in
an old monastery set in an orange grove, they undertook a journey into
the village of flowers for the purpose of buying postal cards. A smile,
a word of appreciation to the good old woman who kept the shop, and
they were loaded with favors; huge bunches of roses were bestowed upon
them, oranges of a size and flavor not before discovered, were offered
them.

“It is Arcadia,” sighed Sidney. “I knew it the moment our little boat
stopped at that old stone landing and we went up, up that vaulted
passageway to the top of the bluff. Every time we came out upon one of
those balconies to rest and looked down on that blue, blue sea I knew
we were ‘under the walls of paradise’ in reality.”

“I knew it before that,” said Gabriella. “I was thrilled with the fact
when the steamer stopped off there in the bay and those little boats
came up and surrounded us. The boatmen looked so picturesque standing
in those tiny tossing things and it was all so unlike anything I ever
knew before. How did you ever happen to pick out the right one, Gem,
when they were all babbling and clamoring so?”

“I have dreamed of this spot for years,” Miss Cavendish told her. “I
read of it long ago and determined, once I had the good fortune to come
to Sorrento, I would stop nowhere else.”

“It is so fascinating,” sighed Gabriella. “Everything about it is
fascinating down to the _major domo_ with his five languages and his
side-whiskers. I shall never forget my sensations when we reached the
top of that old stone stairway and came out at last in the orange
grove. Then when I learned that we could have all the oranges we
wanted, and when I saw those busy little bees at work for us, I knew we
had struck Elysium. I can tell you, dear people, those good bees will
have to get awfully busy now I have come.”

“And then the orange-blossoms and the roses in such profusion,” Sidney
continued the rhapsody.

“And the dinner,” Gabriella took up the strain; “I never ate such good
things in all my life.”

“And all for six francs a day, wine and lights included,” said Miss
Cavendish. “Girls, I vote we stay here two or three days; I’m sure we
shall never regret it.”

“Oh, dearest Gem,” Gabriella threw herself upon her friend in a
transport of delight, “it is what I have been longing to do from the
time I set foot inside the walls, but I didn’t want to interfere with
your plans.”

“Our plans aren’t cast iron,” returned Miss Cavendish; “that is the
beauty of them; we can do what we please when we please and how we
please. If we prefer to stay in Italy the entire six months we can do
it and nobody can object.”

“I am so happy,” sighed Sidney.

“I am so ecstatically joyful,” cried Gabriella, “that I don’t believe
I could stand much more. Oh, the bliss of being here in this spot of
spots, and of knowing that we shall have time to learn it better. We
can stay over Sunday, can’t we, Gem?”

“We can and we will. I don’t know of a better place for that day of
rest.”

Night lay upon Sorrento. Across the bay the lights of Naples twinkled
through the lambent atmosphere. High above the plain the red fires of
Vesuvius once in a while shot up wickedly. From Sorrento’s bluffs one
could look down upon the doubles of stars reflected in the blue waters
beneath. The orange groves sent forth a delicious odor, which, mingling
with the scent of roses, filled the air with a mysterious sweetness
whose source was visibly discerned only when one caught a glimpse of
pale blossoms rioting over the grey walls.

Miss Cavendish and Sidney were treading the path which led between
rows of orange and lemon trees to the edge of the bluff. “We should
certainly hear nightingales here,” remarked Miss Cavendish. “Of all
places this is where I should expect to hear them. It may not be the
season for the full song, yet it does seem to me that I can detect a
very sweet twittering which comes from the depths of that garden next
us.”

“It belongs to the villa of a princess,” Sidney told her. “Gabriella
and I have peeped in and we are dying to penetrate further. It looks
perfectly fascinating like the pictures one sees of such places in the
_Century Magazine_. That was the lodge we passed on our way to the town
this afternoon; that house, you know, where they had all those birds
and monkeys and things. What a perfect night.”

“And what a perfect day, or rather days we have had; each one as
exquisite as it would be possible for weather to give.”

“And to think we saw the Queen of Holland face to face. Wasn’t that
luck? Here comes Gabriella; I hear her calling us.”

“Where are you two?” Gabriella’s voice penetrated the quiet. “Gem,
Sidney? Ah, I thought I should find you here. Isn’t it perfect? But you
can’t stay, for our host has asked some of us to go into the gardens
of the princess, where we can see the illuminations. They are going
to send up fireworks from the village in honor of Queen Wilhelmina.
There is to be a boat race, too, and all the houses along the bluff are
lighted up gorgeously. Come along; the others are waiting.”

Her companions needed no second bidding, and a little party was soon
on its way down the dusty road to the lodge. The garden, when they
entered, was dimly beautiful, but as they advanced they perceived
lanterns swinging from the archways, while upon the marble balustrade
of the long colonnade were set, at intervals, tiny lamps of so
primitive a character that they seemed a remnant of antiquity. “Aren’t
they pretty?” said Gabriella, leaning over to look at them closer.
“They are nothing in the world but tumblers with oil in them and little
lighted wicks floating on top. Did you ever suspect, Sid, to be walking
in such a place on such a night? Did you ever expect to be presented to
anyone’s vision against a background of clipped hedges and marvellous
peacock-shaped bushes and marble statuary and urns and amphoras and
things? When I get rich I shall buy a villa at Sorrento and you shall
both come and spend months with me. I have found the one place in the
world that was made for me. There goes a rocket. Come, we must do honor
to the queen by gazing at her fireworks.”

For an hour or more the little company enjoyed the scene, and then they
were piloted home by their host, sombrely wrapped in his black cloak, a
broad-brimmed hat set upon his dark curling locks.

“He looks as if he had stepped out of an old romance,” whispered
Sidney, “and I feel as if I were here upon some mysterious errand,
stealing through this dim garden, and through these dark unfamiliar
rooms.” At this moment a harsh cry at her very side startled her, and
her sleeve was suddenly caught and held. She gave a slight scream
which brought the keeper of the lodge and, by the light of a swinging
lamp which he turned in her direction, they discovered that a gorgeous
parrot had resented this intrusion and had given a sudden peck at the
passing stranger.

Till midnight the festivities were kept up, and all Sorrento joined
in the celebration, but at last the final rocket soared into the sky
and fell hissing into the waters below. Then only the gloomy fires of
Vesuvius glowed sullenly upon the mountain top while Sorrento slept.

Gabriella, however, remained awake for a long time. New and vivid
impressions had been made too rapidly upon her brain and she stole
from her bed to creep out upon the balcony, thinking the peace of the
night might enter her soul and quiet her. The faint and far tinkle of a
mandolin, the occasional twitter of a bird in the deep grove, the plash
of the water on the sands far below were the only sounds she could
hear. “Night in Italy and I am here, while at home my little mother has
no idea of the joy of it. She is burdened by the cares of the day, by
the never ceasing grind of existence.” The girl sighed, and her eyes
filled. “Oh, sweetest mother, I am thinking of you, and I am wishing
that I could share this rapture with you. It is rapture, this being
here, and across the sea I send you a wish for some great joy to come
to you to-morrow.” After these thoughts Gabriella tip-toed back to her
bed and the morning brought the mother her child’s first letter from
foreign lands.

But on that morrow no one could detect in Gabriella a suggestion of her
mood of the night before. She was all sparkle and gladness, bubbling
over with nonsense and ready for anything. Eager for mental as well as
carnal food, she declared herself. “Like Saint Lucy I seem to keep my
eyes in a dish, I eat so much,” she said. “You might send a picture of
me to mother, and under it write, ‘Saint Gabriella with her eyes in a
dish.’ I’ll take your egg, Gem, if you are not going to eat it.”

“Can you really manage it, Gabriella, with polenta and honey, too, not
to mention all that toast?” asked Miss Cavendish.

“Oh, yes, I can manage it, thank you,” replied Gabriella cheerfully;
“the bees will have to work over-time, that’s all. It won’t hurt them;
I’d do the same for the sake of living in an orange grove and always
having honey for breakfast. I want to learn something about Tasso
to-day, Gem, so please prime yourself, for I don’t intend to lose any
opportunity of improving my mind. I must find out why and when and to
what degree his spirit soared and sung. Any facts gratefully received.
We will repair to the orange grove immediately after breakfast. I
expect to eat at least six oranges before lunch time.”

“You will be in no state then for improving your mind, I fear,”
returned Miss Cavendish.

“Won’t I? Just try me. I am not to be outdone by a little thing
like an extra egg. I am simply the better reinforced. Brain work is
very exhausting to the system and I must repair the waste. Have you
finished, Sid? Were you going to send for some more hot polenta?”

“I have finished. Why?”

“Nothing; I only thought if you couldn’t eat all that polenta I might
help you out.”

“Gabriella Thorne, you shall not have another mouthful,” declared Miss
Cavendish. “I am responsible to your mother for you, and I shall not
return her either a wreck or a glutton.”

Gabriella laughed and arose from her place. “That settles it. I am now
ready for Tasso. Let us to the orange grove; some one will have our
seat if I tarry any longer.”

They wandered down the shady path and established themselves upon
one of the old stone benches by the wall. This spot overlooked the
magnificent expanse of blue sea and sky, with Ischia and Capri hazily
azure on the one side and the cone of smoking Vesuvius on the other.
Far below them glistened the white sands upon which the long ripples
plashed with a gentle murmur. The eye following the line of the bluff
was arrested here and there by some brilliant blossom swinging from its
slight hold in a crannied rock, and the song of a boatman, standing as
he rowed, came sweetly to their ears.

Miss Cavendish carefully spread a shawl over the stone bench littered
with leaves and green with moss. She looked at the lovely scene before
her. “And this was what the young eyes of Torquato Tasso saw,” she said
after a while. “He was born in Sorrento in 1544. He left this fair spot
when he was ten years old and joined his father in Rome. His mother
was of Sorrento. Porzia de Rossi was her name. Tasso was well born and
had more than usual advantages in education. Of course you know that
he wrote ‘Rinaldo’ and the ‘Gerusalemme Liberata,’ the first a heroic
romance, the second a heroic record of the conquest of Jerusalem by
the Crusaders. He was a great poet, so great that his father, no mean
poet himself, at first was jealous, but afterward he rejoiced in the
brilliant successes of his son Torquato.”

“And poor Tasso became insane; I know that much about him,” said
Gabriella.

“Yes, in his case it was true that whom the gods destroy they first
made mad. He believed that he was pursued by secret persecutors who had
declared him a heretic and had denounced him to the Inquisition. These
delusions were not constant and, in this, his native spot, he recovered
his equilibrium.”

“Who wouldn’t?” sighed Gabriella. “I am sure I would. Go on, Gem.”

“But when he returned to the old excitements of court life, the malady
again appeared and he finally died in the monastery of Sant’ Onofrio in
Rome.”

“We must go there,” said Sidney. “I am interested in Tasso. I’d like to
hear more details of his life.”

“That is one of the joys,” remarked Gabriella; “every spot one visits
re-creates a desire to dive deeper into books. I feel my mind expanding
hourly, and the beauty of it is that what you learn over here will
stick, for it will be accentuated by these living pictures.”

“Oh, to know the languages,” said Sidney. “Don’t you feel yourself
a perfect ignoramus when you run across a ragged little urchin,
or a wretch of a cab-driver who can speak fluently two or three
languages? I have been put to shame more than once by the poorest sort
of shopkeeper, who knows English and French besides his own native
Italian.”

“As a nation,” remarked Miss Cavendish, “we are exceedingly well
satisfied. Our language is sufficient for us. We are not dependent upon
foreigners for our bread and butter as the Italians are. Moreover, our
country is so large and, as English is its universal language, we do
not feel required to learn another. Here if they but step over the
border it is to hear a strange tongue.”

“Nevertheless, I don’t think we are the linguists we should be,” said
Sidney. “When I go home I shall take up French and German again so when
I come abroad another time I shall not feel such a goose.”

“May fate order that we be her travelling companions that next time,”
said Gabriella. “Now, what I should like to do, would be to stay right
here in this dear old place and study Italian, read Italian literature
and all that. I’d begin with Tasso.”

“And learn to drop the O from Sorrento, and in fact slip off the
penultimate as most of these of Sorrento do. I’d advise you to study
Italian elsewhere than in Southern Italy unless you are sure of your
master’s knowledge of the language. I should begin, too, my literature
further back than Tasso,” Miss Cavendish went on. “I should take Dante
first and follow him up with Petrarch, though both of them belong
properly to Florence and might better be studied there. Still they were
also Italian, if Florentines, and if one had the time to linger in this
charmed Sorrento, what more delightful than to make a comprehensive
study of Italian literature in this very place?”

“And learn to read it in the original,” interposed Gabriella. “Oh me,
life is much too short to do all there is to do. How can anybody call
his days flat and uneventful when there is a whole world to explore,
if not in the body, in the mind? I wish I were twins that I might have
one of me for the work-a-day world and the other to do those things
which please only my love of the æsthetic. Yes, I regret more and more
that loss of a Methuselah’s length of years, but since we have not time
for plodding, let us take a short cut to-day, so please, ma’am, tell us
more of Tasso. I wish you remembered some of his poetry.”

“Perhaps I do, a little. You are familiar with those well-known stanzas
upon Carthage:

  “‘Great Carthage prostrate lies; and scarce a trace
    Of all her mighty ruins marks the place
    Where once she stood: thus Desolation waits
    On loftiest cities, and on proudest states;
    Huge heaps of sand, and waving herbage hide
    The pomp of power, the monuments of pride;
    And yet does man, poor child of earth presume
    To mourn vain arrogance! his mortal doom!’

“Tasso wrote more than a thousand sonnets and such like poems. I wish I
could repeat some of them.”

“The next time we come to Sorrento we must bring a volume of his poems
with us,” Sidney decided.

“When we go to Florence we will be saying that we must have Dante
and Petrarch, and in Rome--dear, dear, what shall we not want?” said
Gabriella. “No, Sidney, our baby trunks will not hold any accumulation
of books. We shall have to store our minds, and carry our information
as the bees do honey to be placed in the honeycombs afterward. After
this mental effort I feel the need of an orange. Sid, will you help me
to get some for all of us?”

Miss Cavendish picked up her book and the girls wandered off among
the orange trees. She heard their laughing voices in merry, chaffing,
girlish talk. They were so happy that she could not refrain from
joining them. They were leaning over the wall looking at the beautiful
scene before them.

“Sid wants a history,” said Gabriella, as Miss Cavendish came up, “but
I need a dictionary of my own language. I don’t care what this place
has been; all I want to know is where I can find adjectives enough to
adequately express my present admiration for what it is. I have used
exquisite, divine, perfect, delicious, fascinating, bewildering so many
times that I am getting ashamed of myself, and now I am beginning to
say _wunderschoen_ till Sid laughs at me. What am I to do? I simply
cannot restrain my desire to express what I feel, and I am helpless
with such a limited vocabulary. What am I to do?”

“There is no use in telling you to exercise self-control, so I suppose
the only thing you can do is to wear your adjectives threadbare. We can
stand it when we consider the occasion.”

“But isn’t it the most exquisite panorama you ever saw?” said
Gabriella for the hundredth time. “I don’t care a rap about Herculaneum
and Pompeii and ancient Greek civilization when I can glory in the
presence of such color, such composition. I am afraid I am not
historically inclined. I have decided that in my last incarnation I
was an artist. Go to, Sidney. Don’t ask Gem another question about the
different eruptions of Vesuvius. Who cares for stale dates when one can
get fresh oranges?”

“Gabriella, you are incorrigible,” said Miss Cavendish. “Go off and
make those meaningless speeches to yourself while Sidney and I improve
our minds.”

“No, I’ll play the Gamaliel act, too, and sit at your feet,” returned
Gabriella.

“Then you will have to promise not to interrupt.”

“Oh, I can promise fast enough, if that’s all,” returned the girl,
laughing. “But do draw it mild. If you encourage Sid in these
investigations she will demand that you take up the study of cuneiform
and will insist upon buying queer things like the Rosetta stone. There
is no telling, once such a craze overtakes one, where it will lead.”

“If Gabriella is going to keep up this incessant gabble,” said Miss
Cavendish, “you and I, Sidney, would better go somewhere else.”

“I will be good; I promise,” said Gabriella.

“But will you perform?”

“Yes, I really will. To think that Vesuvius was once smiling with
green vines, and that no one suspected it to be a volcano. There,
doesn’t that show my interest and my intimate knowledge of the subject?
Spare me dates, good lady and I am a meek Gamaliel.”

“The first recorded eruption took place in A. D. 79,” began Miss
Cavendish.

“She begins with dates right away,” groaned Gabriella. “I fear my
mortal mind cannot stand it. I will go and write to mother. Farewell,
dears, loath as I am to leave you, I cannot look at Vesuvius
arithmetically. I prefer its ‘misty brim’ to remain misty so far as
history is concerned. Farewell, oh, sapient educator, and inquisitive
pupil. I am going.”




CHAPTER IV

THE BRITON


“Such a gay little cavalcade we are,” said Gabriella, looking back
over the long white road which wound along the cliffs above the bluest
of seas and beneath the bluest of skies. “I didn’t think Gem would
desert us so early in the fray,” she continued, “but I think she really
does enjoy those nice Englishwomen that we met at Sorrento, and she
thought it would be rather fun for us two girls to have this drive
to ourselves. I notice she has discreetly sent us on ahead of her
carriage and that she intervenes between us and that young Englishman
and his friend whom we caught sight of as we were leaving the town. Did
you ever see anything so rakish as these little horses with the long
feather sticking out of their heads? ‘Stick a feather in his cap and
call him Maccaroni;’ that would be a good name for an Italian horse.”

Sidney looked back. “The Englishman’s carriage has passed Gem’s. I
believe they want to lead.”

“Beasts! We shall get all their dust. Where’s the dictionary? What do
we say when we want the driver to go faster?”

“We mustn’t get ahead of Gem’s carriage; we must keep just a little in
advance of it.”

“But I will not have that haughty Briton’s dust, I declare it. I am a
free-born American citizen and I absolutely refuse to be treated with
spurn by any Englishman that ever trod.”

Sidney looked back to gain further information. “They have slacked up.
Oh, Gabriella, look; they are amicably conversing with Gem’s Sorrento
acquaintances. Do you suppose they know them?”

“Perhaps, but don’t look back again as you value your life. I feel
hostile.”

“And why?”

“Oh, because I don’t want them to know that we are aware of their
existence. Let’s talk about Tiberius. My book says that he is still
considered the patron of Capri, and that there they yet regard him with
pride. I’d like to go to Capri and stay a while, although they say that
the tourists are spoiling it. Anacapri is still provincial, I believe.”

“I am sure we found an unspoiled resident of the island,” remarked
Sidney.

“We surely did; I acknowledge that. Sidney, you might look back just
once and glimpse them; as it were. We mustn’t get too far ahead.”

“They are forging along,” Sidney reported, “and Gem is waving her
handkerchief. Does that mean we are to call a halt?”

“It means something. We’ll have to stop and see what. _Cocchiere
fermo._ That is what the dictionary says. I hope it is right.”

“Evidently it is, as we have stopped. Are you going to get out?”

“No, I am going to wait events. I am nothing if not cautious.”

The other carriages came up to them and Miss Cavendish called. “We are
going to have luncheon now, girls.”

“Must we get out?” asked Sidney.

“No, no,” expostulated Gabriella, acquiring an English reserve at once.
“We can drive alongside, Sidney, the other side from the Britons.”

But all this scheming came to naught, for no sooner were the three
carriages grouped by the side of the road than Mr. Owen Morgan and
his friend, Herr Muller, were presented to the girls by the Misses
Bailey, whose friends they were, and it turned out that the Englishman
was not strictly English but Welsh. Gabriella unfroze a little, for
she had a confessed weakness for anything Welsh, and announced that
she considered a Welsh rarebit the choicest of treats. Sidney was
pleasantly polite to the German whose English was meagre but who spoke
fairly good French, and, therefore, in a little while it was really
quite a jolly party. The gentlemen gallantly waited on the ladies,
sharing their luncheon with them, while the ladies produced their own
stores. “To be sure,” said Gabriella afterward, “our stores were much
the best, for that dear delightful old man at the pension had put
such delicious things in our basket, toothsome little cakes and those
delectable raisiny things done up with spices and baked in fig leaves.
We had figs and oranges galore, too, but I must say the masculines
furnished better wine than ours.”

They set off again very gaily after luncheon and all reached Amalfi
together, Miss Cavendish and her girls separating from the others at
this place.

“It is a dear and lovely spot but not as fascinating as the one we have
just left,” said Sidney, “though Miss Mildred Bailey likes it better.”

“I don’t see how she could,” returned Gabriella. “I wouldn’t exchange
this clean, quiet little hotel for theirs, either.”

“It is well to be so content with what is a matter of economy,” said
Miss Cavendish, “for this is much the cheaper.”

“So much the better for that. How did you like the masculine element,
Gem? Now, I come to think of it, I believe that it is because of those
ravening wolves that you have brought your meek little lambs here, so
as to get them away from danger.”

“You are such a very meek little lamb,” remarked Miss Cavendish. “I
noticed what a very faint and protesting bleat you gave to that young
Morgan.”

“Sidney’s French is better than mine, so I naturally turned her
over to the German while Owen Morgan and I talked of Welsh rarebit
and--things. Hasn’t he the dearest Welsh name?”

“It is very Welsh; I don’t know how dear it may be to you,” answered
Miss Cavendish.

“It is very dear to-day, but I cannot tell how it may seem to-morrow.
I saw the elder Miss Bailey looking very hard at me once or twice, but
I knew you, my dearest Gem, could not disapprove of my making myself
agreeable and of keeping up our national reputation for vivacity. I
have noticed that the English girls, the few that I have seen, are not
animated. I suppose Miss Bailey was studying me as a type.”

“We shall see them again,” remarked Miss Cavendish, “for we are going
up to the Cappuchini, and they promised to look out for us.”

But they did not see their travelling companions of the morning, for
Gabriella caught sight of them in the town and insisted that they
should take the opportunity of visiting the famous old monastery before
the Bailey party should have returned to it, and, after the long climb
up the cliffs and a rest under the vines of the garden, they returned
without regret to their own simpler establishment.

“It is certainly a delightful spot, or would be if it were not so full
of new richness,” declared Gabriella. “It is exactly like the pictures
of it on the postal cards, but I like this place better, where I
don’t feel as if we had to pay a _centesimi_ for every breath we
draw.”

[Illustration: “VIEW FROM THE MONASTERY.”]

“Do you notice how we are beset by beggars here in Amalfi?” said
Sidney. “They are even worse than they were in Naples, and that is
saying a good deal. We didn’t have near so many at Sorrento. Come here,
Gabriella, and see them below our windows.”

Gabriella joined her. “I just stepped out here to look at the view,”
continued Sidney, “and there were dozens of them clamoring for _una
soldi_.”

“We can go into that cunning little garden,” said Gabriella, “and get
rid of them. I believe I must not say cunning; it is an Americanism
which will be misunderstood by our English friends, who will think I
mean crafty. I wonder if we shall meet them again. They are not going
on to Paestum, but will return to Naples by way of Castellemare. Gem
seems rather sorry. I think she likes the young men; they amuse her. I
must confess that they also amuse me.”

“I shall never forget that early morning drive to Amalfi,” mused
Sidney. “I should feel well repaid for having crossed the ocean if I
saw nothing more than this lovely southern Italy.”

“If I were to be recalled this minute I should not regret having made
the trip,” remarked Miss Cavendish. “Travelling in this section is
certainly made very easy.”

But she changed her mind somewhat before they reached Pompeii; for,
after having expended their adjectives freely in admiring the splendid
Greek temples of Paestum, they set out to continue their way to Naples
by way of Pompeii. Their experience had been that nearly everywhere it
was possible to find some one who could speak English, and were now
expecting nothing less. They had in the beginning carefully prepared
sentences, studiously constructing them from the dictionary and phrase
book, and then presenting them haltingly only to have them answered
in perfectly correct English, so that it seemed rather superfluous to
worry over the matter of acquiring a strange language, as time went on.

“It did very well at the shops and hotels and such places,” said Miss
Cavendish, looking helplessly at her tickets, “but there seems to be
an unwritten law that at the railroad stations none of the officials
are to speak English. These tickets have a notice attached saying that
they are to be signed somewhere by somebody. I infer, from what I can
make out, that it must be done at the first station, so we must get off
there.”

When this point was reached they all rushed from the train and sought
the ticket-office, none too easily discovered, to learn that their
errand was unnecessary, so they hurried back to their places.

“All that hurry for nothing,” panted Miss Cavendish.

“I shouldn’t have minded it so much,” said Gabriella, “if that
pestiferously officious man had not hampered us by pretending he knew
what we wanted, and after all was only a hindrance. He made me so
mad, and I wouldn’t have given him a penny, although that was what
he expected. Why, he didn’t do a thing but get in our way. If we had
missed the train on his account, I should like to have done something
to him.”

“We changed at Battapaglia, didn’t we?” said Miss Cavendish in the
course of half an hour.

Gabriella did not remember, but Sidney did. “Yes,” she replied, “that
was the place. I remember perfectly.”

“Then we must not fail to be ready to get out there. Not one of these
guards can understand a word we say, so we shall have to look out for
ourselves. There, we are slowing up now. The guard called something.
Didn’t it sound to you like Battapaglia?”

“It certainly did,” agreed the two girls, and they picked up their
traps, and hastened out. Each had a satchel; Gabriella had a package of
Sorrento wood-work; Sidney had a bundle of silk stuffs which she had
bought at the same place; Miss Cavendish had the golf capes and the
umbrellas. It was something to get all these belongings together, but
they managed it only to find that it was not Battapaglia, but a place
similar in name.

“We are fortunate always to be able to get the same train,” said
Sidney, sinking down into her place.

“There is some comfort in knowing the train will wait for us,” said
Miss Cavendish; “they never seem to be in any hurry to start.”

The real Battapaglia was reached in due time; it was plain enough to
discover the name on a big sign, and being sure that this time they
were right the three ladies left the train. But after rushing from one
side of the platform to the other, they found an official who was made
to understand that they wanted to go to Pompeii, and who hurried them
back to the same train which they had just left.

“Isn’t it the most patient, good-natured thing you ever saw?” said
Gabriella, as she sank laughing into her seat. “I never believed a
train could so take upon itself the characteristics of a people. It
simply stands till we get through our vagaries and then takes us aboard
and goes on again.”

“It is a through train, I suppose,” said Miss Cavendish, as if she
rather regretted the fact. “Now we must make no more mistakes, but must
have our eyes open for Pompeii.”

Sidney kept a sharp lookout and at last announced, “This is it. ‘Val de
Pompeii.’ There can’t be more than one Pompeii, can there?”

They gathered up their belongings and fared forth. Miss Cavendish
grasped a guard by the coat sleeve and showed him her tickets. “Si,
si,” he said. But the wayfarers had only walked a short distance up
the platform when Miss Cavendish was seized with doubts. Where was the
Hotel Suisse? the Hotel Diomede? The three retraced their steps and
Miss Cavendish fell upon a passing traveller. “Is this the station for
Pompeii?” she asked.

The man shook his head. “Val de Pompeii. Non Pompeii.” They rushed
tumultuously back, and there still stood the little train as ready as
ever to take them on, and this time they did not leave it till Pompeii
was actually reached.

“Imagine such an experience in our country,” gasped Miss Cavendish,
“but, even over here, I defy anybody to do more than take the same
train four times in one afternoon.”

Both Gabriella and Sidney were mute. The limit of human endurance had
been reached, and when they dragged forth their suit cases for the last
time and found their way to the hotel, it was Gabriella who rushed up
to the smiling host who met them at the door. “Do you speak English?”
she queried anxiously and excitedly.

“Yes, miss,” he replied.

“Thank Heaven!” she ejaculated. “We have found some one we can tell our
troubles to.”

“It is so comfortable to feel that we do not even have to remember
_aqua calde_,” said Sidney, when they had been shown to their rooms and
had given their orders to a neat little English-speaking maid.

“And to think that we shall not have to examine a dictionary before our
appetites can be appeased,” said Gabriella. “No sallying forth for me,
this evening, I shall simply sit in this hotel and gloat.”

“I think we shall all do well to rest,” said Miss Cavendish, “for we
shall need all our energies to-morrow for the ruined city. Pray we may
have an intelligent guide.”

“Who speaks intelligible English,” said Sidney.

Their guide happened to fill both these requirements, and moreover,
added to the merit of good looks the fact that he was from Sorrento.

“I never dreamed it would be so absorbingly interesting,” said
Gabriella, as they came away after spending their day among the ruins.
“I think it was half that handsome guide who spoke such excellent
English. He made it so fascinating to me.”

“He made it fascinating to us all,” said Miss Cavendish. “That
silent city! How many times I shall think of the story it told us.
How many times I shall look back to the sunshiny morning when we
wandered through the desolate streets, in fancy hearing the shout of
charioteers, in fancy seeing the helmeted soldiers, the exquisites in
their robe making their way to the thermæ; seeing Nydia bearing her
flowers, and the slaves with their amphoræ.”

“Dear me, Gem,” cried Gabriella, “you are waxing booky. Didn’t you love
to see the little lizards twinkling in and out the overthrown stones?
Isn’t it strange to think they are the only inhabitants of that old
city, and that people of another race now haunt the place to wonder at
the splendor of a departed glory?”

“Who’s talking booky now?” laughed Sidney. “Come, dear people, we must
finish ‘The Last Days of Pompeii’ to-night or we shall find that it is
lapping over upon some of the things we shall have to read in Rome.”

“Had you thought of making the ascent of Vesuvius?” Gabriella asked
Miss Cavendish the next morning.

“I had thought of it, but it is an expensive trip, and I, for one,
do not need to put my hand on wonders of that kind in order to enjoy
them. I think we can get all the satisfaction we want from a volcano by
looking at it from a distance.”

Gabriella looked a little disappointed. She liked the daring and
difficult things. “There is a way of going up from this side which is
much cheaper,” she remarked. “Our guide told me about it.”

“Oh, but we mustn’t do it unless there is a big party,” Sidney broke
in. “I had some friends who took that trip and they had a dreadful
time. It cost twice as much as they had been given to suppose it
would, and it was really very dangerous, they heard afterward. They
were three ladies who undertook the trip, and their friends in Naples
were shocked to think they had trusted themselves to those strange
guides that no one knew anything about, and who might have robbed them
and thrown them into the crater and no one would have been the wiser.”

“I can vouch for their not robbing me,” remarked Gabriella, with a
laugh. “But that grewsome suggestion of yours, Sidney, cures me of
any desire to go up except in the most commonplace way on an orderly
funicular railway. I must confess I had visions of riding a donkey, or
of being toted by two lusty guides when we came to the steepest places,
but I have no ambition to be thrown into a fiery furnace.” And she
walked off humming, “Where, oh, where are the Hebrew children.”

“I am afraid Gabriella is disappointed,” said Sidney, regretfully,
“but really, Gem, I don’t think we ought to go on that trip. You know
Gabriella’s utter confidence in humanity. She would, like as not, give
one of those men her pocketbook to hold, and so arouse his cupidity. I
have already seen her share her chocolate with the most vicious looking
of cab-drivers, and I am sure she would do the same with those rascally
donkey boys. It wouldn’t be safe.”

“I agree with you,” said Miss Cavendish. “Yet Gabriella’s smiling
confidence and her good comradeship gains us more than one favor. She
will hob-nob with anybody, and is rarely taken advantage of, by even
the most wily old cheats, just because she is so sweetly trusting. That
blind man who gave her the empty match-box would never have done it if
he could have seen her smile.”

“Let us hope Gabriella’s smile will be the means of getting us out
of all future difficulties,” said Sidney, who, being very tired, was
slightly pessimistic.

“What’s that about difficulties?” asked Gabriella, coming in from
the balcony. “We aren’t going to have any. Next time I shall get a
time-table and shall study up all the stations as we go along. You
don’t suppose by any chance we shall miss getting out at Rome when we
get there, do you? There can’t be a Val de Roma, but I’ll make it my
business to find out if there is. Come out, Sid, and hear those dear
men singing ‘Funiculi, Funicula.’ When shall we hear that song again,
I wonder. I am sure whenever I do it will make me homesick for this
lovely southern Italy. Come, Sidney.” And the two went out to expend
their coppers upon the singers in the street below.




CHAPTER V

ROMANCES


Another day found the travellers on their way to Rome. Yielding
to Sidney’s persuasions and those of three fellow _pensionnaires_
Miss Cavendish took first-class tickets that the six might have a
compartment to themselves. “Though really,” said she, “it is a waste
of money, for the only difference that I can see is in tidies or no
tidies; the first-class have them and the second do not, but as the
trains are usually very crowded this time of year it may be as well
that we go this way.”

“We shall be regarded as such rich Americans,” remarked Gabriella.

“But we shall have all the room we need for our comfort,” said Sidney.
But alas, for their hopes, on this occasion it rained for the first
time since their arrival in Italy, and the roof of the first-class
carriage was leaky, so that to obtain any comfort at all they had to
squeeze closely into the four corners to prevent their receiving the
constant dripping from overhead and to keep their feet from the little
puddle of water which gathered in the middle of the floor.

“And they call this first-class,” said Gabriella, as they left their
places when their destination was reached. “Give me second-class after
this. I’ll willingly forego the tidies,--or antimacassars as our
English friends call them,--for the sake of a dry journey. We couldn’t
have been more crowded if there had been ten of us instead of six.”

“Never mind, it is all over now,” said Miss Cavendish, “and we will not
do it again.”

“Is this really Rome?” said Sidney, as they drove through the Via
Nazionale; “it looks so dreadfully new.”

“It certainly is Rome,” returned Miss Cavendish, “but it is not all of
Rome.”

“I am sure there is an old, a very old something,” said Gabriella, who
had caught sight of the Thermæ of Diocletian.

“Oh, but I am disappointed,” said Sidney. “It doesn’t look a bit like
what I expected.”

“This is the modern quarter,” said Miss Cavendish, reassuringly. “I
fancied we would get better air in this direction. When you have looked
upon the wonders of the Vatican, have seen the Colosseum by moonlight,
and have driven out the Appian Way you will recognize the antiquity of
it.”

“And when we have seen the Catacombs and the Forum and all that, I am
sure we shall know it is Rome. There are some soldiers, Sid.”

“Yes, the old Prætorian camp was not far from here and is still used, I
am told.”

“There! what do you want more antiquely suggestive than that?” said
Gabriella. “Imagine Peter and Paul and all those perhaps walking over
this very spot.”

“Yes, but it didn’t look then as it does now,” said Sidney, who had not
recovered from the blow to her expectations. “Is this the house, Gem?”

Miss Cavendish alighted and made her inquiries. “Seven flights up,
girls, and no lift. This is dreadful. If I had only thought to inquire
what floor the _pension_ was on I would never have engaged our rooms
here. I see visions of a worn-out trio when we are through with our
sight-seeing.”

“Oh, well, if we don’t like it we can go somewhere else,” said
Gabriella cheerfully. “You know it was hard enough to get in anywhere
and I am sure this looks very nice. Now, what we want to do is to get
in out of the rain.”

They were not impressed with the accommodations offered them, but the
city was overcrowded, there being the Easter visitors still remaining
and now supplemented by those who had arrived because of the promised
pageant in honor of a visiting dignitary, therefore it was decided
to make the best of it, though the table was poor and the rooms
unattractive. Still, the neighborhood was a convenient one, and their
hostess was a person of unusual intelligence, ready to give them any
information they stood in need of.

“We shall have to stand the dreadful butter and the awful bread for the
sake of the mental stimulants we obtain here,” said Gabriella. “When
we cannot stand it any longer we can get something at one of the rias
outside. I noticed that there is a _latteria_, a _drogheria_ and a
_beccharia_ just over the way,” she added glibly.

“For pity’s sake,” cried Sidney, “how could you notice and remember all
those names?”

“Oh,” returned Gabriella nonchalantly, “I am learning the language from
the signs; I find it an excellent way. I feel the need of sustenance
this very minute after that sample luncheon. Will you come with me, you
two? I will treat you to some chocolate, then we will go to the office,
where I hope we may find some letters.”

“I am developing a craze for photographs,” Sidney announced a day or
two later. “I cannot pass by a shop where they are displayed without
wanting to rush in and get some. We must all go to Anderson’s some
afternoon, and I will treat you each to a dozen.”

“Dear Sidney,” exclaimed Gabriella, “I adore you when you say such
things. And that reminds me, Gem, Sidney is developing a romance, or
I am, I don’t know which it is. We were standing on the Palatine hill
looking at the Italianness of a street down which two soldiers were
slowly riding. A perfect riot of roses overhung the wall on one side,
and one of the soldiers reached up to gather a rose, which he held in
his hand as he rode along. Just as he was opposite us he looked up and
kissed the rose--to me or Sidney? I don’t know which; I only know he
had the most glorious eyes in the world and that he looked a picture.
The strange thing about it is that I met Miss Bailey on the street
afterward and as we stood there talking, who should step up but this
same beautiful military person. I recognized him in a minute, and I
almost think he recognized me. To marry an Italian and live forever in
Italy, what bliss! On second thoughts, would it be? At all events I am
not likely to have the chance of trying the experiment, for all these
Italians of good family are poor, Miss Bailey says, and are on the
lookout for American heiresses. I forgot to ask Miss Bailey what had
become of Taffy, I was so taken up with the sojer man.”

“Taffy?” said Miss Cavendish inquiringly.

“Yes, the Welshman, you know. Mr. Owen Morgan.”

“Am I to continue to have these romances thrust upon me?” said Miss
Cavendish. “I ought to have taken that possibility into consideration.
If you are to have decayed Italian noblemen and thieving Welshmen
tagging us all over the country, what will become of us?”

“Did you say thieving Welshmen, Gem?”

“Yes, Taffy was a thief as well as a Welshman, wasn’t he? and if he
attempts to steal either of my goddaughters he will hear my opinion of
him.”

“Now, don’t get disgruntled, Gem dear; you are in quite as much danger
as we are. I am not a heroine and Sid will not make the most of her
opportunities. I am trying to persuade her to do her hair differently,
and to discard that flippy-floppy blouse she wears. She could look
stunning if she tried. She is the dearest thing in the world, but she
has no more style than a well-worn rag-baby, and you know it is your
own fault, Miss Sidney.”

“When we get to Paris we will put her in the hands of a first-class
dressmaker and stand over her while she decides upon her costumes.”

“That will be fun. You can hold yourself in readiness, miss.”

“I am afraid I shall have spent all my money by that time,” said
Sidney; “there are so many enticing things to buy.”

“Wait till you get to Florence and see the goldsmith shops,” Miss
Cavendish warned her. “Now, if you have nothing else on hand, this
afternoon, girls, I propose we go to _San Paolo fuori le mura_.”

“St. Paul without his gates,” said Gabriella flippantly. “How shall we
go, by tram, or shall we take a cab?”

“Perhaps we would better go the democratic way by tram and save our cab
hire for our drive on the Appian Way.”

“The Protestant cemetery is not far from San Paolo, is it?” said
Sidney, looking up from the Baedeker she was poring over. “We might
take that in, too. I’d like to lay a flower on the grave of Keats.”

“Shelley’s grave is there, too, isn’t it?” asked Gabriella.

“Yes,” Sidney consulted her book, “he is buried there, though his
heart was sent to England. We shall find the graves of Trelawney and
Constance Fennimore Woolson, too, as well as those friends of our
childhood, Mary and William Howitt.”

“Come along then. If we have all those to look up we’d better be
moving.” And Gabriella led the way.

“I think all the world must be possessed to visit St. Paul without the
gates,” remarked Sidney a half-hour later, when they tried vainly to
gain a place in the crowded cars.

“Shall we give it up?” said Miss Cavendish, looking discouraged.

“Never. There must be an end to this dreadful rush at some time,” said
Gabriella. “It cannot be eternal. Meantime I shall amuse myself by
seeing just how cheaply I can buy some of those mosaics that are being
so constantly thrust upon us. I have been waiting for exactly such an
occasion when I should feel savage enough not to weaken when a dirty
little urchin with glorious eyes should offer me marvellous blue and
rosy-posy pins for half a franc. I cannot resist them, when after I
have shaken my head at them they say ‘No-a,’ in that pathetic way.
To-day I am judicial and shall select with calmness and--”

“There comes our car,” cried Sidney, making a rush. And the mosaic pins
were left behind.

“The imposing effect of the vast dimensions and the costly materials
of the church is best perceived from the west end of the nave,” read
Miss Cavendish from her guide book; “consequently we go to the west end
of the nave. It is fine, very fine. I think I like it as well as any
church in Rome.”

“It is very impressive,” murmured Sidney. “There is a good deal of
color, too, not garish, but effective. I suppose it would be heresy to
say that I consider St. Peter’s a bit garish. I like quiet simplicity
better than feverish ornateness, don’t you, Gabriella?”

“Yes, I certainly do, and I like all this very much, though I specially
want to see the cloisters; those I expect to charm me. I begin to feel
very religious when I think that St. Peter and St. Paul had all sorts
of doings around here. That little chapel just beyond the gate is where
they parted on their last journey; over there in that direction is
where St. Paul was executed, and here he was buried. He was a great and
fearless person, though I always preferred St. Peter, myself; he was
so delightfully human.”

“They say this was even a finer church before the fire of 1828,” said
Sidney, viewing with interest the portrait medallions of the popes.
“What a number of those old fellows there have been. Dear me, I feel
thankful for every morsel of Bible study I have ever had; I only wish I
had studied more.”

“It isn’t the Bible study for which I feel a crying need,” confessed
Gabriella, “it is history and languages. Ah, here are the cloisters.
Just look at those beautiful twisted columns; those mosaics. Now I am
happy. You were right, Gem; it was well worth the trouble of getting
here.”

“We might walk to the Protestant cemetery; it’s not far, they tell
me,” said Miss Cavendish as they issued from the church. “The cars are
so crowded, and if we need a cab we can take one after we leave the
cemetery.”

They started out valiantly, but stretch after stretch of road was
covered and they seemed no nearer the cemetery than at first. Finally
Sidney stopped short. “I cannot go another step,” she declared. “Do
let’s call a cab.”

But, alas, no cab was in sight nor did any appear, and the weary
pedestrians at last sat down by the roadside to rest.

“We may as well go on,” said Gabriella after a few moments spent in a
contemplation of their surroundings. “We gain nothing by staying here,
and, really, it cannot be very far now. When you are rested, Sidney, we
will go on, and if an empty cab overtakes us we can hail it. What do
you say to that plan?”

“I agree,” returned Sidney, rising to her feet again.

“Just before the gate is reached a short side street on the left leads
to the Protestant cemetery,” read Miss Cavendish. “I think I have
strength enough left to get there, for the gate is just ahead.”

But Sidney succumbed again before they reached their destination.
“I positively cannot go on,” she declared. “Leave me here, you two,
and go explore for yourselves. I am not going to move from this spot
till a cab comes along.” She sank down on a stone by the way and Miss
Cavendish followed her example. “It is exhausting,” she sighed. “If I
had known there were no cabs to be had in this direction and that it
was so far I never would have come.”

“You all haven’t a bit of pluck,” said Gabriella, laughing. “Here when
we are within sight of the place, to say you won’t go on is ridiculous.”

“Yes, but though that may be the wall of the cemetery, who knows where
the gate is? And even if that were close at hand, how many miles shall
we have to walk before we find Keats’s grave? No, not for all the dead
poets that ever lived will I drag myself further. I shall faint if
I do, and will have to be buried where I lie, another victim for the
Protestant cemetery.”

“That is all nonsense,” said Gabriella. “At all events, I shall go
and explore a little further.” She sauntered off up the street and
presently they saw her applying her eye to a hole in the wall. Then she
began to beckon violently.

Miss Cavendish watched her with interest. “She has discovered
something,” she said. “I think I must go and see what it is.” She
started off to meet Gabriella, and Sidney obediently followed.

“It’s right here,” Gabriella announced as they came up. “You can see
for yourselves. I peeped through that little hole in the wall and there
was Keats’s grave directly before me. Wasn’t that remarkable?”

Encouraged to new effort by this discovery, the three set off for the
gate, gained entrance and laid a memorial flower upon the graves of
the two poets. “I shall never forget them now; never,” said Sidney. “I
shall hold them in remembrance forever after this tramp. Please don’t
walk me outside the gates again, Gem. If I must go, let it be in a cab,
or any way but on foot.”

“It was a mistake,” said Miss Cavendish, “and I will promise not to
lead you astray again. I move we do not go back to dinner, but take the
first cab that comes along, drive to the Pincian hill and watch the
crowds, and then go to a café and have dinner.”

“That will be lovely,” cried Gabriella, “and you will pick out one of
those dear little out-door places, won’t you? I do like them so much
better than the stuffy, smelly in-door ones.”

“If we can find an attractive one, as I have no doubt we can.”

In the course of time an empty cab came along and they were soon a part
of the throng which crowded the Pincio.

“There is Miss Bailey over there,” said Sidney, nudging Gabriella, who,
with head held high, was looking persistently in another direction.

“I know it.”

“You saw her? Why didn’t you tell us?”

“Didn’t want to.”

Sidney gave her a glance of surprise, then turned her attention again
to Miss Bailey. She was accompanied by Signor, the count Rondinelli,
and behind her walked Miss Mildred and Mr. Morgan.

Sidney glanced back at Gabriella, whose head was still resolutely
turned. It was at that moment that Miss Cavendish caught sight of
her acquaintances and she stood up. Miss Bailey, looking that way,
recognized her, and pushed her way through the throng to where they
were sitting. “My word!” she exclaimed, “fancy finding you here. When
did you come? Isn’t there a crowd to-day? One can’t get on at all.
Fancy my seeing you among so many.”

“It is a wonder that we saw you,” returned Miss Cavendish. “Sidney!
Gabriella!” But Gabriella had fled. “Where is that perverse child?”
Miss Cavendish asked Sidney.

“She wanted to walk up the road a little way. She said she would come
back.”

“Perhaps she saw some one she knew,” remarked Miss Cavendish. Sidney
turned the conversation, but out of the tail of her eye she espied Mr.
Morgan followed by the count, both elbowing their way along in the
direction Sidney had indicated.

“I sent the count for Miss Thorne,” said Miss Mildred, “and Mr.
Morgan must have thought I meant that he should go, too.” Her eyes
followed the two, and Sidney smiled, for there was Gabriella with her
two attendant cavaliers, utterly regardless of the havoc she might
be playing in Miss Mildred’s virgin heart. This fluttering, girlish
creature nearly twisted off her thirteen jewelled rings, drooped her
shoulders more depressingly, and rattled her many chains with more
abandon than ever as she stood talking to Sidney in nervous excitement,
her eyes following the fast receding trio. At last she stood on tip-toe
when the top of Mr. Morgan’s hat was the only object by which the three
could be identified, then even that vanished, and Miss Mildred drew a
sigh.

Miss Bailey turned around suddenly. “It’s so curious”--she pronounced
it _kyarrious_--“how independent you Americans are,” she remarked. “Now
I should never think of allowing Mildred to leave my side in a place
like this.”

“Really?” said Miss Cavendish. “But Gabriella is not alone, and she
permits me to leave her side, so why should I not accord her the same
privilege?”

Miss Bailey looked at her with vague distrust. Was this American
chaffing, or did Miss Cavendish really not appreciate the situation?
As the years of the younger Miss Bailey outnumbered those of Miss
Cavendish by half a decade, it may be supposed that Miss Cavendish did
not appreciate the situation.




CHAPTER VI

ROSES


“Rome is so big, so impossible to get acquainted with in less than
years of time, that I think we would do as well to go on,” said Miss
Cavendish at the end of two weeks spent in assiduous sight-seeing.

“Especially as we have not a good _pension_, and as the town is so
crowded,” put in Sidney.

“Oh, for dear Sorrento! all that deliciousness for six francs a day,
wine and lights included,” sighed Gabriella for the tenth time since
she had arrived in Rome.

“I think we will see then what Florence can afford us. I have written
to two or three places there for rooms and have just received some very
satisfactory replies. We really are not any too happy here,” said Miss
Cavendish.

“And we have worked, yes, really worked, harder than anywhere else. In
two weeks we have tried to see what we could never master in less than
ten years. I am tired,” replied Sidney.

“Then we will go on, if you and Gabriella agree.”

Gabriella did agree, and declared that she was yearning for the Uffizi
and the Pitti galleries. Therefore they shook the dust of Rome from
off their feet and were borne along in a crowded train toward the city
of Dante.

“Tea will be served immediately,” said the little maid who showed them
to their rooms when they had reached their _pension_.

“Tea?” exclaimed Gabriella as the maid departed. “This certainly
promises better than Rome. Oh, Gem, we can afford to stay here for a
long time: rooms that overlook the Arno, tea and--”

“Wine and lights included,” laughed Sidney.

“Yes, actually, and all for five francs a day. I don’t see how they do
it. I hope they will not starve us as they did at the last place.”

“My dear,” said Miss Cavendish, “I have learned one thing: when you
want home comforts abroad, don’t go to a boarding-house kept by one of
your own countrywomen, especially if she be a missionary.”

The girls’ spirits rose as time went on, for not only were their rooms
exceedingly comfortable, but they found the fare excellent. To be sure
the house was old and dingy, and it was not of spotless cleanliness.
“But for Italy, well, we might go much further and fare worse,”
remarked Gabriella.

“One could go as far as America and not begin to have all this,”
declared Miss Cavendish, whose experience of American boarding-houses
was not limited. “I do not know where at home we could find good beds,
cheerful, prompt and skilled attendance, delicious food, fresh flowers
on the table every day, a hostess anxious to please, all for a dollar a
day.”

“Wine and--” began Gabriella mechanically. And then they all laughed.

The days went by all too rapidly, and a week passed before they knew
it. “I could hang out this window all day,” remarked Gabriella, after
Sidney had called her two or three times on Sunday morning. “There is
so much to see along this river front. I have been watching a gentleman
spruce himself up for Sunday. He has taken off his shirt, washed it
in the Arno, and you may see it there spread out on the steps in the
sunshine while he sits complacently in his coat waiting for it to
dry. Isn’t that the simple life exemplified? Yesterday I beheld a
scene worthy of a French novel. Two washerwomen took to fisticuffs and
dragged each other over the face of the earth by the hair of the head.
It was dreadful, and yet I had to watch to see whether the big or the
little one came off victor.”

“And which did?”

“Neither, for two men separated them, but there were Vesuvius-like
mutterings all day, and doubtless by this time one or the other is
badly done up. The Italians are so impulsive, you know.”

“That’s a mild word for such a performance,” said Sidney. “Come, do
hurry, Gabriella, we want to go to the Cathedral.”

It was at the Uffizi that they ran across the Bailey party again.
They were standing before a Titian, Baedekers in hand, looking at the
picture with a half interest.

“Miss Mildred still wears her chain bracelet,” whispered Gabriella.

“Yes, and she has a new chain; that makes three that she is wearing. I
suppose the last is one that she has bought here,” returned Sidney.

“I wonder of what the chain bracelet is the symbol,” said Gabriella.
“Every Englishwoman we have seen has worn one. I should really like to
know the why of it.”

“There is Mr. Morgan with his friend, the German,” exclaimed Sidney.
“Shall we discover them or let them discover us?”

“We can move along a little and let them be the discoverers,” said
Gabriella; “it will be more dignified.” But as she spoke Miss Cavendish
had recognized the others and in a few minutes the two parties had
become one.

At the end of half an hour Gabriella found herself with Mr. Morgan,
separated from the rest. “Dear me, where are they?” she exclaimed,
looking around in dismay.

“They can’t be very far,” Mr. Morgan assured her. “It’s jolly easy to
lose one’s way in a place like this. We’ll meet them at some convenient
point, no doubt.”

“And if we don’t I am so near home that it makes little difference,”
said Gabriella, resolving not to trouble herself. “This place is such a
joy; in fact, Florence is all a joy.”

“It’s rather a nice old place,” said Mr. Morgan.

“Oh, dear, why can’t you English be more enthusiastic?” exclaimed the
girl. “You never rise to superlatives unless you use horrid words like
beastly and rotten, and even then you don’t rise, you sink.”

Mr. Morgan laughed. “And you Americans are so very enthusiastic. You
rave over such remarkable things.”

“Who wouldn’t rave over that Botticelli, for example? I suppose you
would say that is not a superlatively fine picture.”

“No doubt it is for those who care for Botticelli.”

“And you don’t?”

“I care for others more, though I do see some things to admire in his
work.”

“Then let us go on. I will not stand here with such an unenthusiastic
person. I will come back when I can gloat over this by myself. I want
to be with some one who can rave or with no one at all, when I look at
a picture like that. If there happens to be anything in this collection
which appeals to your fieriest ardor, lead me to it.”

Her companion laughed and sauntered leisurely on, Gabriella following.
At last he paused before a madonna of Andrea del Sarto’s. “Is this
it?” asked Gabriella.

“Do you like it?”

“Ye-es. Please let me hear you rave.”

“I did not promise to.”

“You are trying to fool me. I am sure this does not appeal to you more
than anything in the gallery.”

“No, but I like it. Don’t you?”

“I do, but I always see del Sarto’s horrid little wife in all his
Madonnas. They all have that discontented expression, and they make me
mad. I always think of Browning’s poem on poor Andrea. Oh, you little
beast!” She shook her fist at the picture to the horror of a group of
Italians standing near. Seeing their shocked looks, Gabriella laughed.
“They think I am somebody dreadful; an anarchist, no doubt, or a
lunatic, at the very least. I forgot what the picture represented; I
was thinking only of the model. Now show me something that you really
do admire.”

“Here is something; Raphael’s portrait of Pope Julius II.”

“Do you admire it because Baedeker gives four and a quarter lines to
it?” Gabriella asked saucily.

“No, because it is rather a good thing. You have seen the Madonna della
Sedia, of course. You must admit that it is beautiful.”

“It is much more beautiful than I expected to find it, for when poor
reproductions of an exquisite thing are scattered broadcast over the
earth, it is hard to see the beauty when you come face to face with
the original. I sometimes wonder if after all it isn’t a mistake to
familiarize the masses with the beautiful through such means.”

“I think it is well, if it is not overdone.”

“And the tendency is to overdo. Santa Claus, even, is no longer a
mystery when every cheap John shop has a mock figure of the saint in
the shop window, performing tricks for a gaping crowd, and he is even
reduced to the base purpose of advertising some quack medicine as he
stands on the corner and gives out hand-bills. That is one thing I like
about Italy; it still retains some of the old illusions. We are fast
out-growing them at home.”

Mr. Morgan looked down at the girl with an amused expression. “For a
young person of your tender years, that sounds rather blasé, and from
you who adore enthusiasm, too.”

“That’s just it; I love enthusiasm. I don’t want to outgrow my dear
illusions, and I do not want to be compelled to use the modern process
of dissecting everything. I would rather not tear the veil from the
mysteries. Let the children of this world make their discoveries for
themselves.”

“Here is something that’s not half bad,” said Mr. Morgan, stopping
before a fine portrait.

“You like Titian, don’t you?”

“Well, rather.”

At this moment Sidney came upon them from a side gallery. “Oh, here you
are,” she said. “We are ready to go, Gabriella. Miss Bailey is coming
with us. She wants to try a meal at our _pension_. She is nothing if
not enterprising in adding to her addresses. She has just given Gem six
for Venice, and grateful Gem has asked her to lunch, or is it breakfast
we have at this hour?”

“Where are you all?” Gabriella asked.

“In the Tribuna waiting for you. Hasn’t it been a perfectly delightful
morning? Have you and Mr. Morgan seen everything?”

“We have seen several things. No one could see everything here in
one short morning,” returned Gabriella. “I hope I am not the kind of
American who rushes about Baedeker-possessed, and only looks at the
things he stars. I have the greatest respect and affection for my
Baedeker, but I do like to observe with some sort of originality. I saw
several rushers this morning. Do you remember the one on the steamer
that we called the Microbe? She was here.”

Sidney cast an amused look at the young man standing by, who looked
unmistakably puzzled. “I remember,” she replied.

“I asked her if she had seen a delicious little thing in one of the
rooms, and she rustled over the leaves of her guide book and said:
‘Baedeker hasn’t starred it; I don’t believe I have looked at it.’
‘He hasn’t even mentioned it,’ I said, and she looked at me as if I
were some sort of queer specimen. I suppose she wondered at my daring
to form an unauthorized opinion. Isn’t it a blessing to have a mind of
your own?”

Mr. Morgan laughed. “You certainly have. Is that Miss Mildred over
there buying photographs?”

“I wonder if she is buying another Madonna,” said Sidney. “She has
bought three already, none of which is the special one she is looking
for.”

“Why does she buy them, then?” asked Gabriella.

Sidney laughed. “I don’t know. She discovers only too late that what
she has just bought is not her favorite.”

“Well, I never,” remarked Gabriella, reserving further comment till she
should be alone with her friends.

Miss Bailey now saw them and came fluttering up, her sister following.
The latter was all filmy veil and dangling chains with clinking
ornaments. Her manner was that of a belle of the last century, for she
dipped and tripped and undulated to the last degree. Evidently she
considered Mr. Morgan her especial cavalier, for she chid him for so
long deserting her, tapping him playfully with her fan. Miss Cavendish
here joined them and all took their way to the street.

“And where is Herr Muller?” Mr. Morgan asked Sidney.

“He has gone back to his hotel,” was the answer.

“He though you were lost, naughty boy,” said Miss Mildred, catching the
remark, “and he went to find you.”

Mr. Morgan made no reply, but a few minutes later, when he and
Gabriella fell a little behind the others, he said: “Let us give them
the slip this afternoon, and go to the rose gardens of San Miniato.”

“Oh, I can’t,” returned Gabriella, after a moment’s hesitation, “I’ve
promised to go haunt the goldsmith’s shops with Sidney.”

“The ones on the Ponte Vecchio?”

“Yes; and we are anxious to see Casa Guidi windows.”

“You will be disappointed in them, but you will not be disappointed in
the Boboli gardens, if you are going there. I may be on that side the
river myself, this afternoon.”

“I thought you were going to San Miniato.”

“Not by myself.”

“There is Herr Muller.”

“Yes, but one wants to see roses under special conditions. You remember
how you feel about the Botticellis; grant me the grace of feeling so
about roses.”

“But Herr Muller would surely say _wunderschoen_ often enough to please
you.”

“He might, but I don’t want any but English enthusiasm.”

“I am sorry American is not sufficient for you, but there is Miss
Mildred,” said Gabriella wickedly.

Mr. Morgan’s face immediately became imperturbable, and Gabriella felt
a little ashamed of her small fling at the older woman. She relieved
her confusion by exclaiming, “Oh, see those lovely saffron roses that
man has. They remind me of Sorrento. I must get some for Gem. Think
of it! only twenty centimes, four cents.” She buried her face in the
flowers, exclaiming: “You beauties, how I adore you!”

“I knew you loved flowers,” said Mr. Morgan, “and that is why I want
you to go to San Miniato with me.”

“I will go to-morrow,” said Gabriella hastily, turning aside to give
the roses into Miss Cavendish’s hands.

The glory of an Italian spring lay over the gardens of San Miniato.
Thousands of roses gave a responsive loveliness to the favors of sun
and soft air. Gabriella, who had felt a little guilty at leaving her
comrades out of her plans, and who had wondered if it were quite the
proper thing to make this excursion with so recent an acquaintance,
lost all sense of discomfort when she saw the loveliness before her.
“Ah,” she sighed, “it was worth coming to see. It is Eden before the
fall. It is all the romance of Italy, all the sunniness concentrated in
the hearts of these roses.”

Her companion smiled. “I knew you would express the poetry I can only
feel.”

“And there are so many of them,” Gabriella went on. “I never could have
believed it. Isn’t it lovely to be up here and to look down on the
historic city? The Medicis, Dante, Savonarola, Romola, the Brownings,
how they all come to one’s mind.”

“But don’t you know,” said her companion, “a simple Welshman of the
engineering profession cannot follow you in these flights. I only
feel the poetry of the roses, and I only see the Florence of to-day
enveloped in a haze at my feet.”

“Oh, but surely, surely you have read Romola and some of Browning at
least.” Gabriella was vaguely disappointed.

“I am sorry to confess that I have not read Romola, and of Browning I
am scared.”

“You mustn’t be, and you must read Romola.”

“I will at once. I will stop on my way back and get a copy, and you
shall pick it out for me, if you will.”

“That is better. I begin to have hopes of you. Before we leave Florence
I may be able to set your feet in the right way.”

“And when do you leave Florence?”

“In a few days, I am afraid. There are some of the churches we have
yet to see, and we have not been to Fiesole. To me Florence is almost,
if not quite, as inexhaustible as Rome, and in many respects is more
fascinating. Have you happened to see a funeral at night? It is the
most impressive thing you can imagine. It is much more so than at
Naples, where they carry an empty coffin and make a great to-do, but
all in the glaring light of day. But we must be leaving this kingdom of
Rosedom, for it is time to be getting back.” Her companion, however,
lingered, and finally, under protest, filled her arms with roses and
they returned to the city.

“Late to luncheon again,” said Miss Cavendish, as the girl came in.
“We were just going down. What beautiful roses, and what a mass of
them. Have you been squandering your substance in that kind of riotous
living?”

“No,” replied Gabriella, depositing her burden in the water pitcher,
“they were given to me.”

“Take care,” warned Sidney. “Roses will be your destruction yet.
Remember the rose of Rome.”

“‘Ah, but where blooms the rose of yesterday?’” quoted Gabriella. “Who
cares for the roses of Rome when one can have the roses of Florence?”

“And have you been mooning all morning over there at San Miniato?”
Sidney asked.

“No, we have been sunning,” answered Gabriella, flippantly.

“What do you know of that Mr. Morgan?” asked Miss Cavendish in her most
judicial tone.

“Let me see, what do I know?” returned Gabriella speculatively. “He is
from some utterly unpronounceable place in Wales, but he was educated
in England. He is a civil engineer, very civil, I should call him. His
father was a clergyman, but he is no longer in the land of the living,
and his mother died recently. The unpronounceable place he still calls
home, but Owen ap Owen goes where his profession leads him. Just now
he is off for a short holiday, having come here from Germany with the
Misses Bailey, who were great friends of his mother’s. They were very
kind to her once when she was ill away from home, nursed her as if they
had been sisters, and have been devoted friends to her at other times,
hence the young man’s sweet acceptance of Miss Mildred’s attentions.
He didn’t tell me that last, but I draw my own conclusions, and gather
that there is no harm in her little dabs and dips. I believe that is
all I can report at this present time, but given the opportunity, I
have no doubt I can satisfy any amount of curiosity on the subject.”

“Gabriella, Gabriella,” was all Miss Cavendish vouchsafed in reply as
she led the way down to luncheon.




CHAPTER VII

“IN A GONDOLA”


The consequence of the morning’s adventure was that Miss Cavendish
hurried away from Florence before these dangerous meetings should be
repeated, and although Gabriella would like to have protested she
confided to Sidney that she had not the face to do so.

“I have no business to give Gem frights when she is doing all this for
me. It is very hard for me to behave myself with your perfect decorum,
Sid, and though I was having a lovely time with Taffy, I could not say
a word, for Gem feels responsible to mamma for me.” This was whispered
confidentially during the journey while Miss Cavendish was absorbed in
her Baedeker.

Venice was reached in the evening. Miss Cavendish had written ahead
for rooms, and they stepped into the gondola they had selected, with
pleasant anticipation of looking out from their windows, that night,
directly upon the Grand Canal.

“Isn’t it perfectly delicious?” said Sidney. “Don’t you feel as if you
were in a dream? We are actually in a gondola, Gabriella, and we are in
Venice.”

“Don’t speak to me,” said the girl; “you might wake me up. I am
perfectly happy, and I want to do this for the rest of my life. Oh,
how queer it is to go threading our way along these narrow little
waterways. Ah-h, this must be the Grand Canal, and here are the
palaces, and oh, the color and the wonder of it all. You have given the
gondolier our address, Gem?”

“Yes, and I think we shall find we have a good situation.”

The gondola drew up by the side of a tall gloomy building which Miss
Cavendish remarked, must have been at one time a palace.

“And to what base uses has it come; harboring American tourists,” said
Gabriella. “What ho, there! Do you see anyone about, Gem?”

All was silent and unresponsive, but at last, after repeated summons,
the proprietor appeared. He spoke French readily. He was grieved to
assure the ladies that not a room in his establishment was unoccupied.

“But I wrote ahead,” explained Miss Cavendish.

“But madame, the letter was never received.”

“I don’t believe a word of it,” said Miss Cavendish as they pushed
away. “He had my first letter all right, for he answered that. He
probably had a chance of renting his rooms before we arrived and would
not miss the opportunity of making a little extra money. Fortunately it
is not the only place.” She gave the gondolier another address, and
the gondola slipped along through the green waters until another halt
was made.

“No room” was the report brought to them.

“Never mind; we do not need to be discouraged; I have six addresses
here,” Miss Cavendish assured the girls, “and we shall have more of
this delightful way of getting about.”

But Venice, like Rome, was overcrowded, and each time they were turned
away they became a little more anxious till Miss Cavendish, at the end
of her addresses, turned to the gondolier appealingly. It was growing
darker and darker. The tall palaces loomed up each side, gloomy and
silent. Lights from the large hotels flashed out upon the water. Black
gondolas glided by, dusky, shadowy forms.

“I feel as if this were the river Styx and Charon were at the prow,”
whispered Gabriella.

Sidney, subdued and troubled, turned to Miss Cavendish. “Do let us go
to one of the larger hotels just for the night,” she begged.

“We shall have to, if no other place can be found,” was the answer. “I
told our gondolier that we should have to sleep in the gondola unless
he could get us lodgings, and he assured me that we need give ourselves
no anxiety; he would find something.”

But place after place was left behind, and the gondolier, himself,
became eager to settle his passengers. He was a pleasant young fellow,
graceful and picturesque. He knew a little French and ventured a
remark now and then, smiling at the worried ladies and bidding them
take courage, he, Antonio, would not leave them till they were housed.
There were rooms in abundance, but it took time to go from one house to
another.

At last they turned from the Grand Canal into the broader Giudecca.
Antonio ran lightly up the steps of his first stopping-place and in a
few minutes returned, snatched up the luggage, and bade the ladies to
follow him. Up the walk of a tiny garden their guide preceded them. A
woman with a candle appeared at the door. She led the way upstairs to a
dingy room which seemed in every way unattractive.

Miss Cavendish turned helplessly to the girls. “I don’t know about
this,” she said. “I am a little afraid. It seems queer and out of the
way and-- Are you sure it is safe, good, well?” she asked Antonio. He
responded emphatically that it was all things that it should be. He had
discovered them lodgings, and evidently considered that he had done his
duty. Miss Cavendish felt herself disarmed.

She meekly thanked him, paid him, and let him go. Then she turned to
their hostess. Not one word did she speak of any language but Italian.
But she was quick to understand that they wished another room, and led
them to what appeared to Miss Cavendish as the very dingiest and most
unattractive of little rooms at the back of the very small house. It
seemed ill-smelling, and by the light of the one candle it looked bare
of comforts.

“It will never do in the world,” decided Miss Cavendish. “I cannot let
either of you girls sleep there; it is away off from the other room,
and I am not willing to be separated from you.”

“It seems almost as if it might be the haunt of bandits, doesn’t it?”
whispered Gabriella, her eyes big with anxiety. “Don’t let us stay
here, Gem. I am afraid we shall all be murdered in our beds by morning.”

They returned to the front room, and Miss Cavendish viewed the
possibilities. “If a bed were put up in this hallway, or whatever
it is, opening out of this room, we could all be together, and if
we locked all the doors, you see there is one at each end of the
passageway, I think we could feel safe.” She made known her desires
to the _padrona_, who, anxious to please, agreed to everything. A
bed was set up in the little hallway; it was further furnished with
a wash-stand and chair, and the tired travellers took possession,
though it is safe to say that no one slept much, although the beds were
comfortable, and they were undisturbed except by their own fears.

The next morning disclosed to their view a broad canal upon whose
waters lay many ships, a stretch of land beyond showed domes and spires
glittering in the sunlight, and above all was the bluest of skies.
Below the window appeared a small garden where a woman, with a baby by
her side, was gathering flowers. Miss Cavendish smiled at her fears.
What had appeared at night to be ill-conditioned and forbidding, by
daylight proved to be only unpretentious simplicity. The little house
was old, the furniture dingy, but everything was very clean and the
mother’s voice as she talked to the child had a caressing softness that
dissipated Miss Cavendish’s last fears.

“Get up, get up, girls,” she cried. “We are not in the house of a
bandit, but in the simple home of poor, but kindly people. There are
flowers in the garden and a dear little prattling baby. I saw his
mother’s face and I know she couldn’t do us harm.”

Here the _padrona_ came in with _aqua calde_. She was very solicitous
for the welfare of her guests. She gathered up skirts and shoes,
returning with them well brushed. A little later she brought the
breakfast tray; flowers adorned it, the linen was spotless, the coffee
fragrant and well made, the butter fresh and sweet, the bread tender
and delicious. Never was a more willing, devoted, anxious hostess. The
three, whose alarms had kept them awake half the night, smiled at each
other shamefacedly. And when at noon, a table was set for them out of
doors under the vines, and such a dainty meal was served as they had
seldom tasted, they concluded that Antonio was wiser than they.

“And we thought that dear, good little _padrona_ with her big brown
eyes and her wistful smile was a robber witch,” said Gabriella.

“And we were going to look for other quarters the first thing in the
morning,” said Sidney. “I vote we stay.”

“Stay? Why of course we’ll stay,” said Miss Cavendish, “for I have
learned from that nice looking Englishwoman with whom I was talking,
when you came down, that our host has been cook to a prince, that he is
one of the best in all Venice, that he has lost his savings by a bad
investment and that he has begun life again in this small way, hoping
to retrieve his fortunes. He is honest as the day, though very poor. I
couldn’t have the heart to leave even if we were less comfortable.”

And indeed, as the days passed, they were more and more convinced that
they had fallen on their feet, for never were more delicious meals
served a party of appreciative females; never was more devoted service,
never more real kindliness exhibited.

“I simply love the _padrona_,” said Gabriella. “I shall hate to leave
her. She has so much sweetness and modesty, with a certain dignity
which makes her gratitude to us pathetic.”

“And how delightfully quiet and away from crowds it is here,” commented
Sidney. “I shall hate to leave this homelike little place. I like it
much better than on the Grand Canal. We have our sky and garden if we
are not in a palace.”

“And goodness knows, it is cheap enough,” put in Miss Cavendish.

“And there are no porters and waiters and maids to catch the unwary,”
said Gabriella. “The dear little _padrona_ is the only one who serves.
It makes us wonderfully free, doesn’t it?”

“I feel as if I were one of the people,” said Sidney. “All I want is a
black shawl. I have already begun to imitate the arrangement of hair
practised by the Venetian women. I hope you notice it.”

“I do,” Gabriella told her, “and I congratulate you upon the change. Do
get the shawl, Sid; it would be so funny to see you parade it at home
in all its funereal simplicity.”

“I’ll get it to-day. Why is it, I wonder, that black gondolas and black
shawls seem charming in Venice when anywhere else they would be too
depressing for words.”

“It is because they are the accent in this riot of color. Everything
here in Venice is in such a high key, that the touches of black are
a relief rather than the opposite,” said Gabriella, who was quick to
perceive and analyze effects.

“When our hungry souls have been sufficiently fed on the glories of San
Marco and when we have gone again to the little bead shop on the San
Moise; when we have seen the Santa Barbara and have taken another trip
to the Lido, I suppose you girls will be ready to go on,” said Miss
Cavendish.

“I shall never be ready to go on,” responded Gabriella. “We have hardly
stopped in a place where I have not longed to linger for months. I am
yet sighing for Sorrento while I adore Venice, and I pine for Florence
while I have not had half enough of Rome. I want to go to San Marco at
least a hundred times more, and I shall never get all the beads I want
till I buy out the entire shop. Then there are the lace factories and
the glass works to see; though I think we would better leave you at
home, Gem, when we go to see the laces; you have nearly ruined yourself
buying them as it is.”

“I think I have spent more in laces than Gem,” put in Sidney.

“One doesn’t have such a chance every day,” Miss Cavendish returned
apologetically, “and it is so hard to resist beautiful lace. You know I
bought very little jewelry in Florence, while you girls were actually
spendthrifty.”

“We must have one more night in a gondola,” said Sidney; “it would
never do to go away feeling that we might have had that pleasure and
deliberately set it aside. No, Gem, we must stay a little longer. We
may never find a place where we can be so delightfully free. Nobody
knows us and we know no one; it is very lucky that it has happened
so. We are sufficient for each other. We don’t have to bother about
our goings and comings, our toilets, or, in fact, any of the usual
conventionalities. We can sit on the steps of Santa Maria della Salute,
and watch the gondolas and the sky and all the rest of it, with the
working class, and nobody cares; or we can gather around our little
table under the vines and discuss personalities with no one to comment.
Oh, it suits me down to dots.”

“A gondola and moonlight,” murmured Gabriella, “does suggest other than
female companionship.”

“You are thinking of roses and San Miniato,” Sidney declared. “I
prophesy that your culminating romance must be connected with a rose.
By the way, what has become of our military friend? Wasn’t he coming
here? Have we been so happy as to escape him?”

“I hope so,” returned Gabriella. “We certainly saw enough of him in
Rome. It seemed to me that we never turned a corner but his blue cloak
was in evidence.”

“Who shall say that all girls are daffy over uniforms?” exclaimed
Sidney. “Though I am sorry he can’t be here to make a romance for the
gondola, since you require the masculine element. Gem and I can get
along without it, and to-night we shall be happy while you will feel an
aloofness because of an unfilled want.”

“You don’t suppose I am such a lunatic as not to get as much pleasure
out of such a trip as you,” exclaimed Gabriella. “Am I to be accused of
being blasé at this late hour? I, who have simply simmered and bubbled
and boiled over with enthusiasm all the way?”

Sidney laughed. She had succeeded by her sly effort in arousing
Gabriella’s indignation, and was satisfied.

Nevertheless the moonlight ride was not predestined to be lacking the
masculine element, for, as the three were standing on the quay by the
Accademia, who should step up to them with a joyous exclamation, but
Signor Rondinelli, who, with his blue cloak thrown gracefully over his
shoulders, looked extremely picturesque, so much so that Gabriella,
with true artistic insight, decided that he made a most fitting
accompaniment to the evening’s entertainment. He was eager in his
polite attention, as if, having come up to the “fleeting joy,” he did
not intend letting it escape him again. As the gondola drifted out upon
the silent waters, glistening undulating ribbons of light were thrown
waveringly from the windows of the palaces across the canal, slipping
down from the golden brown of Gabriella’s hair to the shining beads
around her neck, and then gliding off into the water. Miss Cavendish
and Sidney spoke seldom, preferring the dreamlike quiet, but the steady
murmur of low-voiced conversation came from the other two. Once in a
while Gabriella’s light joyous laughter chimed out upon the night.
From other gondolas came strains of music; the tinkle of a mandolin, a
man’s mellow baritone in some gondolier; a woman’s soprano piercingly
sweet in a pathetic love-song. At intervals the weird warning cry of
the gondoliers added to the effect, and when at last they drew near
their landing place, even Gabriella had hushed her chatter.

[Illustration: “THE GONDOLA DRIFTED OUT UPON THE SILENT WATERS.”]

It was but a few steps to their lodgings and the girl peremptorily
dismissed her cavalier at the steps of the quay. She watched the
gondola glide away, then turned with a half sigh. “He is a dream in
that blue cloak,” she said. “If every night were moonlight and if one
might forever drift in a gondola it might do, but alas, there would be
the gondolier to pay, and who would do it?”

“Why these enigmas, Gabriella?” asked Miss Cavendish.

She laughed a little amused laugh, in which there was a tinge of
regret, too. “Only because Signor Rondinelli has made the mistake of
thinking I was that boon to the impecunious nobility, an American
heiress. He actually thought it was I and not Sidney who carried bags
of ducats around with me, and--and--”

“And--what? There is an interesting emphasis on that conjunctive,” said
Miss Cavendish.

“I was obliged to disabuse him of his impression, when he came to
making love too violently. I can assure you I rather enjoyed the
unwonted position until he offered me his hand and his honored name.
So, Sidney, be on your guard; he will probably turn his attentions to
you.”

“You didn’t tell him that I was an heiress,” said Sidney in dismay.

“No, but some one has told him that one of us is. Perhaps he thinks
it is Gem. You’d better have a care, Isabella Cavendish, or you will
yet occupy an Italian villa and possess beautiful old furniture and
pictures, and perhaps all the Venetian point you can wear.”

“Not until I can buy it with my own hard money. Certainly not if an
impecunious nobleman goes with the other goods and chattels.”

“Like a statement I saw once, where a man returning to Europe after a
long residence in America, was said to have taken all his household
goods, including the body of his mother,” remarked Sidney.

This took them laughing into the house, to be met by the little
_padrona_, candle in hand to light them to their rooms.

But the influence of the night still lay upon Gabriella, and after she
was ready for bed, she leaned from the window, her hands clasped, as
she rested her arms upon the balcony rail. “And to-morrow we leave,”
she said, as she felt Miss Cavendish’s presence at her side. “Must we
go, Gem? How can I leave Italy thinking that I may never, never come
back again? It hurts; it really hurts. I didn’t suppose I could feel so
about anything less than a creature, an individual of humankind, but
Italy does not seem a country; it seems a goddess upon whose breast
we lie while she whispers tales of mystery and romance. She speaks in
her pictures, her sky, her lovely land, her childlike people. She is
something more than a place on a map. Don’t you feel so?”

“Yes,” sighed Miss Cavendish. “I, too, go with reluctant steps, for I
have found the land of youth renewed and dreams fulfilled.”




CHAPTER VIII

FROM SEA TO MOUNTAIN


“All of Italy that remains for us is to be compressed into the next
two or three days,” said Sidney regretfully, as she watched the last
red sail fade from sight upon the lagoons of Venice. “Oh that those
days were limitless and that we could recover that lost power of the
ancients who counted their years by centuries. If one might live to
be as old as Methuselah, for example, it would be nothing to spend a
hundred years in Italy. I almost believe I love Venice the best of all.
How about you, Gabriella?”

“I am not sure. I think Sorrento comes first with me, and then
Florence, though it is hard to decide. I think I love it all from the
top of the boot to the toe, and would be satisfied to live anywhere in
it between Switzerland and Sicily. How do you suppose Signor Rondinelli
became possessed of the idea that I represented the wealth of the
party?” she asked suddenly.

“Miss Bailey must have told him so,” replied Miss Cavendish. “She
evidently discovered that one of us is not a pauper, and was under the
impression that it was you.”

“Oh!” returned Gabriella, and lapsed into silence.

“I think it would be good fun if you would keep up that impression,”
said Sidney, after a pause. “Think what numbers of romances you might
have. Your personality plus gold would attract the heiress seekers as
sugar does a swarm of ants.”

“But where would your innings be?” questioned Gabriella.

“I don’t want them. I couldn’t cope with those brilliant and beautiful
soldiers if I had the opportunity. I think it would be much better to
allow me the retirement my looks afford, and let you go forth to battle
with the fortune hunters. I was ever ‘a violet by a mossy stone’ you
know. I hope you did not tell the count that you refused him because
you were not able to fill his coffers.”

“No, I must confess that I did not. I felt at the time that it was
rather mean of me to keep on sailing under false colors, but now I am
glad I did. I do believe, Sid, that it would be fun to change places. I
should not in the least mind carrying out the plan, and should like to
see confusion written in the various languages. I know how it appears
in Italian already. Perhaps we shall have German next. It is a go, Sid.
I am the heiress, if you please. You shall see how well I will fill the
rôle without ever declaring in so many words what I wish to suggest.”

They watched the landscape from the car windows and presently Sidney
nudged Gabriella. “Please to see our opposite neighbor. I envied him
his neatly packed basket of luncheon when we came in, but I do so no
more.”

Gabriella glanced at her vis-à-vis to behold a thin red stream
trickling down upon the man’s shoulder. He was gazing out the window in
utter unconsciousness that he was losing the better part of his flask
of wine.

“Would you dare to tell him?” whispered Sidney.

“We needn’t, but Gem can. She is absorbed in her accounts, but when she
has stopped reducing that last column of francs and centimes to dollars
and cents, I’ll speak to her. She can’t bear to be interrupted when she
is doing her sums, you know.”

“And in the meantime our Italian friend will lose all his wine, and
what is a meal without wine to a Latin?”

“Tell him then.”

“Oh, I can’t; I shouldn’t know what to say, and Gem has the dictionary.”

Just at this moment Miss Cavendish looked up, a smile of satisfaction
upon her face. “It is better than I thought,” she announced. “So far it
has cost us but fifteen dollars a week apiece for everything, board,
lodging, washing, travelling expenses and--”

Here Sidney clutched her. “I can’t stand it another minute. It will
soak through. Please tell him.”

“What?” Miss Cavendish turned an amazed countenance upon her. “What are
you talking about, Sidney?”

“That man, and his bottle of wine,” she whispered. “Do tell him that it
is leaking.”

Miss Cavendish grasped the situation, and after presenting a disjointed
sentence to their travelling companion, was given voluble thanks in
perfectly good English, to the utter confusion of the girls. The
bottle was then restored to a perpendicular position, while Sidney and
Gabriella vainly tried to suppress an attack of giggles.

“And to think,” whispered Sidney, “we have been disclosing our inmost
thoughts.”

“And Gem has gone so far as to confide to him the state of our
finances. Did you ever know such first-class idiots as we are?”

“But he looks so Italian,” murmured Sidney, “as if he never had even
heard a word of English before. I hope he does not understand enough to
distinguish what we are saying under our breath.” But the rest of the
way little was said by any of the three ladies, and when the Italian
left the carriage, at Verona, all breathed a sigh of relief.

“All the same,” said Gabriella, after she had graciously returned the
very polite bow he made at leaving, “we had our fun out of him, if we
did afford him amusement. I wish, however, that we had let the wine
drip its very last drop before we had told him.”

“You revengeful creature; I am sure he could not have been more
unobtrusively polite,” said Miss Cavendish. “We never in the world
could have told, by his expression, that he understood a word of what
we were saying.”

“That’s just what I have against him,” returned Gabriella; “he ought to
have looked as if he understood and then we shouldn’t have made such
geese of ourselves.”

“Nevertheless, it was his intention to be as courteous as possible,”
Miss Cavendish insisted. “Indeed, I think the most humble of these
Italians could give us lessons in politeness. I shall never forget our
dear little _padrona’s_ beautiful courtesy.”

“Yes, and didn’t you feel like some high muckamuck when the entire
family, even to the old grandmother, followed us to the water’s edge
and stood there bowing till we were out of sight?”

“And they were so grateful for the largess we bestowed,” added Sidney.

“The smalless, you mean,” Gabriella put in, “for we do not break
ourselves when we give tips.”

“I am sure,” said Miss Cavendish slightly aggrieved, “we give enough.
It seems to me that I have tipped everybody and everything in Italy.”

“Except your soup plate,” broke in Gabriella saucily; “I notice you
are never guilty of tipping that.”

Miss Cavendish paid no attention to the interruption but went on: “They
usually expect so much from Americans, that I think it is unjust to
others to give more than seems fair. I am perfectly willing to give as
much as the service is worth, but when it makes it difficult for those
who have to economize, I think one should forbear the overpaying. It
is indulging one’s self in generosity at the expense of one’s fellow
countrymen.”

“Shall you ever forget the bland way in which that delightful old
fellow in Naples said, when we discovered that he had charged three
prices: ‘but you are so reech-a and we are so poor-a?’ It seemed quite
reason enough in his mind, and he was not in the least abashed at the
fact of his having been detected.”

“They are like children,” returned Miss Cavendish, “and for that reason
we can forgive them much.”

“We are leaving Verona,” said Gabriella, poking her head out of the
window. “I didn’t notice it before. I wonder if our friend of the wine
flask is one of the two gentlemen of Verona.”

“He certainly is a gentleman,” remarked Miss Cavendish, still defending
their late companion. “Why do you smile, Gabriella?”

“Oh, only because I shook my head and scowled so savagely at two women
who were making for the carriage, that they backed away and went into
the next. I think now we shall have this to ourselves the rest of the
way.”

“I don’t mind travelling with the people,” said Sidney. “They are
rather entertaining, and one learns many things about manners and
customs, in a train.”

“It seems to me that we had enough of it this morning,” said Gabriella.
“If another man with a lunch basket comes in, I shall not be able to
stand it, I am afraid. Why didn’t we get one of those nice little
baskets, by the way?”

“Because we shall get to Milan in time for our next meal,” Miss
Cavendish told her.

“Did you hear that American voice? Why do such people travel? What do
they get out of a trip?” said Gabriella.

“What was she saying?” asked Miss Cavendish.

“She announced to the world at large, very much through her nose, that
she meant to travel first-class. ‘I can’t stand them fumeries,’ was
her parting remark. I suppose she came abroad because her opposite
neighbor went last year, and she will travel as rapidly as she can in
order to get over all the ground possible; three months, no doubt for
an extended tour of Europe. Can’t you fancy it? Oh, Gem, you certainly
were a wise woman not to join a party. What might we not have had
thrust upon us?”

“You are a little too severe, dearie, for there is a deal to be gained
from travelling with others. Travel at least ought to teach us to live
and let live, and we ought to return home with a broader charity.”

“Or else with a ruined disposition,” returned Gabriella saucily.

“Answer for your own,” laughed Miss Cavendish; “mine has already been
severely tested.”

“Wicked, bad old woman to talk so to her dear little goddaughter,”
returned Gabriella. “I’ll never come over again with you.”

“Then I can bring Sidney, who never says naughty things to me.”

For answer Gabriella snuggled up close to the older woman, called her
all sorts of pet names, and made “love-eyes” at her as she had done
from babyhood.

“There is one thing we all must learn,” said Sidney, watching the
by-play, “and that is to cultivate a gentle tone of voice. That woman’s
rasping notes still ring in my ears. I notice that there are very few
Americans whose voices cannot be heard above all others.”

“Oh, but consider; we do not screech like peacocks, as the Italians
do,” said Gabriella in her slow drawl. “Do I speak like an American
phonograph, Sid? If I do, I’ll talk no more.”

“Oh, you, no, I didn’t mean you,” returned Sidney quickly. “To be sure
you would never be mistaken for an Englishwoman, still you neither
whine, talk through your nose, nor clip your words. I think you will do
if you will remember not to shout, nor laugh loud when you are excited;
it is then that we Americans lose control of our voices.”

“Alas, alas,” sighed Gabriella, “I believe you are right. Please call
me down when I soar too high, and I’ll do the same for you. Gem never
forgets herself.”

“She has had the advantage over you of fifteen years of practice,”
remarked Miss Cavendish, “and she has likewise lost her girlish
excitability.”

“She has not lost her enthusiasm, though; she will never outgrow that,”
said Gabriella affectionately.

But here Milan was reached, and Gabriella rushed from the train to find
a porter to take the luggage. It promised to be a difficult task, for
the passengers were many and the porters few. “_Facchino! Facchino!_”
called Miss Cavendish, her head out of the car window.

“_Facchino_,” called Sidney the other side, but not one seemed able to
spare time to attend to them.

Gabriella clutched first one and then the other, but all were already
spoken for. “Do go and help the child,” said Miss Cavendish to Sidney.
“I will watch the luggage.” And Sidney joined forces with Gabriella.
Yet up to the time the train was ready to start not one disengaged
porter could be found. “What shall we do?” cried Miss Cavendish in
despair. “I can’t leave the luggage, and I must get off.”

“This is where our American system of checking seems mighty fine,” said
Gabriella. “I’ll come in and we’ll tumble out the baggage, not luggage,
if you please on this occasion. We can manage it somehow.”

But just here a soft voice behind Miss Cavendish asked, “What is the
matter? Can’t we help you?” and turning, she saw two Englishwomen
who had taken places in this special compartment. “The train will be
going,” they warned her; “you’d best get off,” and they summarily
bundled Miss Cavendish from the carriage, and by the strength of their
own beringed hands and braceleted arms lifted the heavy hand trunks
through the windows just in time for them to be received by their
anxious owners.

“Oh, dear,” said Gabriella, looking after the departing train, “I wish
I could run after it and thank them again. Did you ever see such dear
kind things? I foresee plainly that I shall become an Anglomaniac
before I sail for home. I must get myself in training, for now I see
why the English girls of necessity must be athletic.”

“I feel quite overpowered,” said Miss Cavendish. “They were certainly
friends in need. I suppose we might have lifted down those trunks
ourselves, but every minute I hoped we could get hold of a porter, and
I was afraid to leave the things for fear they might be stolen, or the
train would start. That certainly was an experience I do not want to
repeat.”

“We have never had any trouble before, and I have been so proud of my
little trunk, but I begin to think it might be better to register.”

“Oh, no, we need not do that, I am sure,” said Gabriella. “We shall
probably never have such an experience again, and we have saved no end
of money by always having our trunks in the carriage with us wherever
we went. I should not wonder if we could take them over the Simplon
pass with us. Next time if we don’t get hold of a _facchino_ right
away, I shall lug them myself.”

After the quiet waterways of Venice, Milan seemed bustling and noisy.
“I don’t like it,” declared Sidney. “Take out the cathedral and
Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, and it may share the fate of a buried
city for all I care. It is noisy, wicked and uninteresting.”

“Ah, but the cathedral is well worth stopping to see,” said Miss
Cavendish as they left the door of the great church.

“The light streaming across those vaulted arches was wonderful,” said
Gabriella dreamily. “I shall never forget that, and as for the Last
Supper, dilapidated as it is, there is nothing to compare to it in
all the well preserved copies which share the room with it. Leonardo
alone seems to have had a vision of his Lord. Oh, what a pity, what
a pity that so great a triumph of art should be lost to the world as
eventually it must be. Nothing has ever impressed me more. Surely
Leonardo was inspired if ever artist was. No, Sidney, I don’t regret
coming to Milan, though now that we have seen the cathedral and that
great picture I want to go.”

“If it were the opera season,” remarked Miss Cavendish, “we might
feel that it would be worth while to linger, but I agree with you,
Gabriella, we have seen all that has any charm for us.”

“So now for the lakes and that heavenly ride over the Simplon pass. I
know it is going to be heavenly.”

“Unless it should be a rainy day, and you know it is so likely to rain
in the mountains,” said Sidney.

“You old pessimist,” cried Gabriella. “It isn’t going to rain, or if it
does, only a very little, just enough for us to see the clouds rolling
around the tops of the mountains and the beautiful distance breaking
through as we come down into the valley.”

“What do you know about it?” asked Miss Cavendish.

“I am like the little boy who had eaten green apples and who suffered
therefrom; when his Christian Science aunt insisted that he had no pain
in his little tum, that it was only imagination, he said: ‘I reckon I
know better than you; I have inside information.’ That is my case. My
prophetic soul tells me that we shall have a glorious trip.”

“I most devoutly hope so,” returned Miss Cavendish, “for I have been
thirsting for that mountain scenery for days.”

“Let me see, this is the plan, isn’t it? We leave early to-morrow
morning for the lakes, spend a couple of days thereabouts and arrive
at that place with the funny name--Domodossola, in the evening. I am
sure I shall like that town or village or whatever it is. Then the next
morning we get into a real diligence, and go over a real Swiss mountain
pass, all snow and glaciers and such things. Much as I hate to leave
Italy, I shall be glad to get to Switzerland, for I think Milan is an
ugly link between the two, and I shall be glad to leave it.”

“But not the cathedral?” interposed Miss Cavendish.

“No, of course not; it is Milan’s saving grace, to my mind. Without
that I should remember it only as a bad, ugly, noisy place and I don’t
care who hears me say it. Besides, the maid told me to-day that among
the lower classes cats are considered as an excellent article of food,
and that the poor things, even when they are known to be pets, are
frequently stolen to be cooked and eaten. Isn’t that horrible? Almost
like cannibalism, isn’t it? No, I shall have no glad memories of
Milan.”

“Gabriella, are you sure you are not making that up?” asked Sidney.

“No, I really am not. It was what the maid told me.”

“Then she was hoaxing you.”

“She seemed perfectly serious, and she speaks English very well, so I
could not have mistaken her. No, after that hullabaloo that kept up in
the street the entire night, I am ready to believe anything of this
place, and I yearn for a peaceful Swiss valley.”




CHAPTER IX

BELLS


It was a temptation to linger in the region of the beautiful Italian
lakes, but two days sufficed to give the trio such glimpses as made
a lasting impression, and it was still May when they arrived in the
quaint little village of Domodossola. Seeking the hotel which Miss
Cavendish had selected as being a modest establishment, they were
ushered into a large room with bare board floor. There were two beds
in the room, and sufficient furniture for comfort, but the space was
so large that there seemed shadowy corners fading away into dusky
emptiness, and a stairway which led directly from the room to the floor
below suggested all sorts of possibilities.

“Shall we dare to stop here?” asked Sidney. “I feel as if a company
of bandits might creep up that stairway in the night and murder us in
cold blood.” But Gabriella stole down the stairs and returned with the
assurance that the door at the foot was securely locked on their side.

“There is a fascinating little balcony out here,” she said, opening the
long window. “It is exactly like a scene in the opera, Fra Diavolo, I
think. We are evidently right on the public square, the market place
or whatever it is, and there are ever so many interesting things to
see; the people themselves are like stage people. See that soldier
sitting at the table down there with a friend, and the little maid
waiting on them. I think she must be Zerlina. Don’t you expect to hear
them troll out a drinking song? Oh, I am sure this isn’t a real place;
it is a stage setting, and we have come into it by mistake, for we are
a part of the scenic effect: ladies on a balcony. I wonder what kind of
dinner they will give us. You see I am returning to stern reality.”

The dinner met their expectations, and was served in such a way as to
heighten the stagey appearance of their surroundings. They spent their
evening on the balcony watching the arrival of the market people who
began to appear just after dark to prepare for the morrow’s market. All
sorts of wares were brought in; vegetables, plants, dairy products,
fish, clothing, notions and what not. A donkey bearing loaded panniers
would be followed by a man bending beneath a burden packed upon his
back; a man driving a cow and calf would precede a woman carrying a
wicker basket filled with bleating kids. Another would bear a yoke, the
two ends balanced by bundles whose contents could not be discovered.
Queer stocky figures many of these Swiss peasants had, big heads set on
bodies scarce larger, but with sturdy thick arms and legs which looked
as if they might have belonged to a taller race. “Misfits,” Gabriella
called them, but the broad faces, if stupid, were good-natured, and the
stout legs were able to carry them up many a steep mountain climb.

Till a late hour the bustle of arrivals kept up, but just as the weary
travellers had dropped into their first slumber they were awakened by
the sonorous notes of an unusually fine street-organ. “There’s the
orchestra,” said Gabriella sleepily; “the opera is about to begin.”

“It is really the finest perambulating organ I ever heard,” said Miss
Cavendish; “at first I thought it was a full brass band. Imagine
hearing such a thing away up here in this little mountain village.”

“I am much too sleepy to sing Zerlina to-night,” said Gabriella; “they
will have to go on without me. I hope they have an understudy.” And she
slept again.

In the morning when the travellers took their places in the diligence
the market was in full swing, and the street below their windows was
filled with a busy throng. With a jangling of bells and a snapping of
whips the diligence swept out of town, and then began the delights of
a day half sunshine, half shower, just as Gabriella had hoped for.
The season was early and the snow still lingered in many places, but
the power of the sun had set free many of the mountain streams which
leaped in thread-like cascades down the mountain sides or dashed
tumultuously through the valleys to join the river further on. The pass
had been opened but a few days, and as the higher parts were reached
the diligence clattered over an icy road through snow tunnels and along
a way banked high on each side with masses of snow.

“And three days ago we were eating those dear little strawberries down
there in Italy,” said Gabriella, “and were uncomfortably warm. See one
of our horses eating snow, Sid; he takes a mouthful whenever he can
snatch one as he trots along. Isn’t he funny? I like to see animals
with individual tastes.”

“Isn’t it cold and grey and desolate away up here?” said Sidney. “Do
you realize that we are far up in the Alps, Gabriella?”

“Oh, dear, yes. I am thrilling with appreciation at every revolution of
the wheels. We are driving directly into a storm. I can see it ahead.
It is lucky we decided upon these inside places, and that there is just
room for the three of us. Everything is lucky and I am almost as happy
as when I landed at Naples.”

“For enthusiasm commend me to Gabriella,” said Sidney laughing; “I
believe she revels in the prospect of a storm here in these mountains.”

“I do revel,” answered Gabriella. “Don’t those clouds look weird
wrapping themselves around that mountain top? Now the rain comes
pelting, but I don’t believe it will last long, for we shall get
beyond it, and down into that little green valley with its toy houses.
I can just catch a glimpse of it down there.”

Mid-day brought them to Simplon where lunch was served and the horses
were changed, then through ever varying delights of scenery they
continued their journey, watching the clouds gather frowningly over
some mighty mountain top, soon to break away and disclose patches
of blue, which broadened into a sunshiny sky smiling over a verdant
valley, and sending shining beams across the silver peaked mountains
from which sparkling streams issued and forced their way in a
myriad rainbow waterfalls to the river below. Quiet valleys, fields
besprinkled with flowers of every hue, pasture lands where tinkling
herds cropped the lush spring grass; all these fair visions appeared
till the final stop was made at six o’clock in the little town of Breig.

“But we are not going to stay here,” Miss Cavendish informed the
others. “We are going on to Visp; it is a smaller place, and I think we
shall like it better. Then, too, we shall be that much nearer Zermatt,
which we are determined to see.” So to Visp they proceeded, and arrived
at a clean little inn overlooking a pretty garden where they found
themselves the first guests of the season.

A perfect chorus of bells awoke the sleepy travellers in the early
morning. To the gravely regular pealing of the church chimes was added
a tinkling accompaniment of cow-bells and goat-bells as the herds
skipped past the small hotel on the way to their pastures after the
morning’s milking. Gabriella lifted her head drowsily. “I never knew
what Alpine bells were before,” she murmured as she sank back into a
semi-slumber.

After a while the chiming and tinkling ceased, and Miss Cavendish arose
to look out upon the quiet, mountain-girdled village. The sun was
shining gloriously upon the dazzling peaks. In the neat garden below
early flowers were blooming. The village lay hushed and peaceful in the
encircling embrace of the mountains, and seemed far away from the rest
of the world. Nothing could exceed its quiet serenity.

“Get up! Get up!” called Miss Cavendish to the girls. “You are missing
such glories as you may never see again.”

Gabriella sat up in bed. “Did you ever hear anything so sweet as those
bells?” she said. “At first I thought I must be dreaming, and then I
remembered all that I had heard of the melodious music of the Alpine
bells.” She slipped on her wrapper and pattered across the floor to
Sidney’s room. “Wake, harp and lute,” she called. “This is another
world of enchantment. We shall have milk and honey and delectable food
for breakfast, and then we must go and look upon that river that was
tumbling and dashing through my dreams all night.”

Sidney needed no second call, and they were not long in occupying the
places set for them alone in the homelike dining-room. But though in
a land of flocks and herds, the butter failed to come up to their
expectations, though the honey was in evidence. After deciding to take
the noon train to Zermatt they started out to explore the village.
Leaving the level plain of the main street they climbed up to where a
quaint old church stood over against the bank of the brawling little
river. The place was so quiet that it seemed almost as if they had it
all to themselves, except when a group of children laughed out in their
play or a woman’s voice was heard calling to a romping boy.

“I am glad we must come back to the dear peaceful little place,” said
Sidney after they had said good-by to the rosy-cheeked, friendly little
maid who watched them depart. “I think I like the name Visp, better
than the French Viege; it seems to suit the village better.”

“Yes, it sounds keen and crisp like the air,” returned Gabriella.

“It was very near to being destroyed by an earthquake,” Miss Cavendish
read from her book.

“I am glad it was spared for our delectation,” said Gabriella. “Now we
have a mighty climb, haven’t we?”

“Yes, we go up nearly a thousand metres higher. Zermatt lies 1620
meters above the level of the sea.”

“Do tell me in feet,” said Gabriella. “I never can remember how much a
meter is.”

“It is about 39 inches. Calculate for yourself,” said Miss Cavendish.

Gabriella shook her head. “I won’t attempt it, and I really don’t care
to know about such sordid things as feet and inches at such a time
as this. Did you ever see such a mad, brawling, utterly uncontrolled
stream as this little Visp? I find it very satisfactory, for it is just
what a mountain stream should be; it suggests glaciers and avalanches
and banks of melting snow. It is so noisy, too, but I love its wild
music, and I am glad to have made the acquaintance of such a charming,
mad little river. I shall never forget it.”

“We get very close to some of these small villages,” remarked Sidney.
“Some of them look as if they had come out of a box of toys and were
made to set under a Christmas tree. I think I like those overhanging
houses the best.”

“Glaciers before us and on every side,” announced Gabriella as they
climbed higher, “and oh, the fields of flowers, hundreds and millions
of delicate little bells of all colors. I am glad we came early, even
if we do miss some of the sights. I do hope we shall find some of those
lovely blue and pink and purple beauties when we get to Zermatt. I’d
like to go right out into the fields and sit in their midst.”

“There is the Weisshorn,” exclaimed Miss Cavendish suddenly.

“Don’t let me miss the first glimpse of the Matterhorn,” said Sidney
when they had recovered from this view of a mighty mountain peak. But
at last when the wonderful, lonely, isolated white pyramid arose to
view they were all silent and tears came to Sidney’s eyes. “I wish
mother were here,” she whispered.

Gabriella gave her hand a little squeeze. “That’s just how I feel,” she
said. “It is too splendid to enjoy without those you love best.”

They found but one hotel open, so early was it, and to this they
repaired. It was delightfully comfortable, and since the regular season
had not begun the prices were not beyond their expectations.

“I think it is a great scheme to come ahead of the crowd,” said
Gabriella. “Everyone is so glad to see us, and they are glad to give
us the best rooms and all the attention we want. Besides it is far
more pleasant to find that the most beautiful places are not thronged
with curious or indifferent tourists. Yes, I think it is wise to come
to Switzerland when everyone thinks it is too early. There are enough
people in the hotel to make us feel as if it were not kept up solely
for our benefit, and to prevent our fearing that the cook will not put
forth her best efforts. As usual we have done the right thing. You
are such a bright and shining light of a personal conductor, Gem,
that even when you scare us into thinking you have made a mistake it
turns out to be the most fortunate thing that could have happened.
Now, if you are ready we will climb up to those little huts on the
mountain-side. I simply cannot wait to reach them.”

“Gabriella is in her most optimistic mood,” said Miss Cavendish. “I
think she should write a book and call it: ‘Europe through rose-colored
spectacles.’”

“But aren’t you ecstatically happy? Don’t you think just as I do?”
asked Gabriella in a surprised tone. “If you don’t feel that way, you
are my only disappointment.”

“In that case,” returned her godmother, “I shall have to acknowledge
that I am in a state of perfect content, and that you are a large
factor in making me so. Now we are ready, dear Impatience.”

The climb up the mountain-side was not difficult, and, yielding to the
effect produced by balmy air, sunlit flower-strewn meadows, inspiring
views of mountain and valley, their exuberance took them as far as the
three huts. Their way was carpeted with flowers of such beauty and
variety as they had not dreamed of finding, and Gabriella had her wish,
for she could sit down in their midst. “I feel riotously prodigal,”
she said. “I don’t know the names of any of these dear things, and I
couldn’t do justice to them if I were to attempt to describe them, but
I am going to gather just a very few to send to dear little mother;
these forget-me-nots, and these harebells, or whatever they are, and
that lovely white thing. Oh, the blue-bells, the cow-bells, the flower
bells and the church-bells of Switzerland, how beautiful they are. What
are you thinking of, Sid?”

“I was looking at this magnificent view, and was thinking that probably
there are other places just as beautiful, of which we know nothing, and
which are rarely visited by the general tourist. You know it is not so
many years since Zermatt became known to travellers.”

“And were you wishing that you could happen upon such a place and enjoy
it unspoiled? One does feel that way once in a while. It is selfish,
I suppose, but it is quite natural,” said Miss Cavendish. “I hate to
think of the flora of these mountains ruthlessly plucked up by hordes
of visitors, so that certain varieties are getting scarcer every
year. If it were not for the good work done by the Society for the
Preservation of the Alpine Flora no doubt many species would disappear
altogether.”

“Do you know that I have just thought that it is possible that the
Gorner Grat railway is not running,” said Gabriella. “I can see the
road, but I believe I have heard that it will not begin travel till the
first of June. Oh, dear, I shall have to admit that I am to experience
a disappointment.”

Their fears were realized when they returned to the hotel and were
told that they were too early for an ascent by way of the railway. “Of
course it is disappointing,” acknowledged Gabriella, “but there is so
much to enjoy, that we can spare that.”

“Instead of blue glasses for these snowy peaks, Gabriella still wears
her rose-colored spectacles,” remarked Sidney with a smile.

But the next day it rained incessantly and mountain climbing was out
of the question. They did undertake a moist excursion around the
town, stopped a moment with dripping umbrellas by the graves of the
unfortunates lost in their adventurous attempts to scale dangerous
peaks, but it was rather a desolate sort of expedition, and they
returned to their comfortable quarters to make up accounts, write
letters and to read the folk lore of the region, which was rich in
legends and thrilling tales of perilous undertakings. Yet the weather
did not encourage a longer stay than another night, and the next day
they were welcomed back to their little inn at Visp by the cheerful,
friendly maid whose exact position in the household it was hard to
define, but who received them as if they were old and well-tried
friends just returned from a long journey.

“If I were worn out, a blasé, nervously prostrated creature instead of
the brisk spinster that I am,” said Miss Cavendish, “I should choose
this restful little spot to recuperate in. I should enjoy a long stay
here as it is, but with an American eagerness to see all that time
and money affords I am afraid that forward must be the word. It is too
early for that ride over the pass to Chamounix, and so I think we shall
go right on to Geneva. I find few of the passes are open, and I am a
little regretful, in spite of Gabriella’s enthusiasm, in the matter of
being on hand early. I am afraid the vanguard doesn’t always get the
best of it.”

“I don’t care,” put in Gabriella lightly; “I have seen the Matterhorn,
and I would rather that than any other mountain. We can get a glimpse
of Mont Blanc from Geneva, and we shouldn’t want to climb it anyhow.
I am perfectly satisfied to go anywhere you want to take me; it’s all
grist that comes to my mill.”

“Gabriella, you dear child,” said Miss Cavendish, giving her a hug,
“your unwavering enthusiasm and cheerfulness are worth a fortune.”

“Just watch me when somebody offers me a fortune for it,” returned
Gabriella, laughing.

“What is our route?” asked Sidney, looking up from the map spread out
before her.

“We take the train as far as Villeneuve, and there we shall get a
steamer which will carry us around the upper shore of the lake. My
first intention was to stop off at Martigny and go by diligence to
Chamounix, but as the pass is still closed to travel, we shall have to
substitute this other route.”

“It is a lovely one,” declared the girls. “We shall be able to see all
the dear little towns and the castle of Chillon, and all that.”

“We shall have plenty of time for luncheon at Villeneuve,” Miss
Cavendish told them, “and we shall reach Geneva in time for dinner.”

“If we have a fine day it will be a perfectly delightful trip,”
remarked Sidney.

“It will be a fine day,” decided Gabriella. “Have we had anything else
except in Rome, and that time when we travelled first-class, and that
was punishment for our extravagance, I am sure.”

“What about yesterday’s deluge?” said Sidney.

“Oh, that doesn’t count; it always rains in the mountains, and besides,
that was another first-class venture, for it was a superior sort of
hotel. We don’t go first-class this time, do we, Gem?”

“Only upon the steamer. I did want to see the ‘sweet vale of
Chamounix,’ but I suppose it will be there when I next come this way.”

“Oh, that next time, that next time. How confidently we speak of it. It
takes a deal of supposing to get to all the places we have to leave out
now,” said Sidney.

“But we have all the fun of supposing,” said Gabriella. “I feel sorry
for those persons who cannot enjoy air-castles.”

They reached Villeneuve at high noon. The streets of the clean bright
little town seemed almost deserted, for everyone was at the mid-day
meal. “I think it would be great fun to go foraging,” said Miss
Cavendish. “What do you say, girls? Let’s go around to the shops and
see what we can find; then we can have a picnic lunch down by the
shores of the lake. There doesn’t seem to be a soul about, and we can
go tramping where we like.”

The girls agreed enthusiastically, and they soon discovered a neat,
appetizing little bake-shop which offered such a tempting array of
rolls, buns and cakes that it was difficult to select from them. Cheese
and salame were found at the butcher shop, the door of which was found
to be locked, though a persistent rapping brought a breathless boy from
around the corner, who, after wiping his mouth on the back of his hand,
opened to them. A grocer near by supplied fruit, chocolate and wine, so
the well-laden trio took up a station near the steamboat landing, where
undisturbed and unobserved they ate their luncheon with relish.

Comfortable places on the deck of the steamer were easy to find, and
skirting the blue lake, touching at fair little towns upon its border,
they continued throughout the afternoon.

“I like it,” announced Gabriella, after she had settled herself. “It is
all blueness and mountain glistenings, and pretty white villaged towns
and coolness tempered by sunshine. Lake Geneva is just what I imagined
it to be. Now, if I had but been allowed to read Byron’s poems by my
godmother I might repeat to you the ‘Prisoner of Chillon,’ but as I
know only a few lines of it you will have to say it yourselves, if
either one knows it.”

“I can only remember:

  “‘There are four towers of Gothic mold
    By Chillon’s dungeons dark and old’--

or is it cold? I forget,” said Miss Cavendish.

“And I can recall something about ‘My hair is white but not with
fright,’ and I am not sure as to that,” said Sidney.

“Never mind, we all know the story, and it will mean just as much to us
when we come to the place,” said Miss Cavendish.

“I’d like to make a circuit of the lake and stop at each little place
for a day,” remarked Sidney, “and I should like to have done the same
at the Italian lakes.”

“Shall we stop off somewhere? We can as well as not,” suggested Miss
Cavendish. “You know we are burdened with only hand baggage.”

“If it were not for the letters waiting for us in Geneva we might,”
said Sidney doubtfully, “but it has been so long since we could have
our mail that I think we would better go on.”

“And Sidney will get that specially fat letter which she always grabs
so eagerly and then flocks off by herself to read. Of course it is from
her brother,” said Gabriella teasingly.

“A clean, wholesome, orderly, cheerful little city is Geneva,” Miss
Cavendish made the comment when they were established in comfortable
rooms, “but it need not delay us long, although we could find much to
interest us here. It is the birthplace of many celebrities and has
borne its part in many struggles.”

“We shall want to hear the musical boxes,” said Sidney.

“And we must go to the shops,” said Gabriella. “I have been told that
they are excellent, though why I should visit them I don’t know, except
from curiosity, for my pittance of spending-money is nearly gone now.”

“You forget your rôle of heiress,” said Miss Cavendish.

“So I do. Then I will pretend that I can spend with a lavish hand, and
will pick out what I would buy if I could while you and Sid make the
real purchases; that will amuse me and take off the edge of my desire.”

The pile of letters was waiting for them, and if Sidney slipped a
particularly thick one in her bag, so did Gabriella start and look
conscious when an unpretentious envelope, bearing the postmark
“Florence,” was placed in her hand.




CHAPTER X

“CHIEFLESS CASTLES”


The week at Lucerne was one of perpetual rain, and the feast of Corpus
Christi, which took the trio to the place at this special date, was a
grand fizzle, for if it had drizzled and misted and showered during
most of the other days, upon this special one was a steady downpour
which prevented the annual procession from taking its route over the
old bridges and interfered seriously with the parading of holiday
attire. With her two charges, under the shelter of umbrellas, Miss
Cavendish took up a position upon the steps of the Cathedral, where
a dripping host passed them, climbing the way to the church. There
was little to be seen of the advancing procession but a multitude of
umbrellas held at various distances from the ground, water-soaked and
overspread with running rivulets. Some marched bravely, disregarding
the persistent flood, but the little girls, who had started out
white-frocked and garland-decked, presented a sorry appearance as the
red of paper roses and green leaves mingled with the pervasive moisture
and stained the white frocks hopelessly. Draggled and parti-colored,
these looked forlorn enough to bring distress to the countenances of
the disappointed little girls.

“Lucerne is beautiful enough and attractive enough in every way to
invite us to stay longer,” said Miss Cavendish, as they wended their
way back through the sloppy streets, and under weeping trees to their
_pension_, “but there seems to be no end to this rain, and what good
are mountains hidden under a pall of cloud? What is the use of a lake
upon which one dares not venture in a boat? Where is the enjoyment of a
garden with wet paths and soaking benches? What are views seen through
a veil of descending drops? I can imagine that when the sun is shining
this is an entrancing place, but in rainy weather--well, I think we may
as well move on. What do you say, my sweetings?”

“Oh, we are not so wildly enthusiastic about paddling around in rubbers
and rain-coats as to object to any scheme you may have in mind,”
remarked Gabriella. “Where next, Gem?”

“To Heidelberg, thence to Mayence, and down the Rhine to Cologne.”

“That sounds enticing. I’ll pack my trunklet at once,” said Sidney. “My
imagination begins to riot among castles and crags and--”

“Students,” put in Gabriella. “Heidelberg suggests students first
of all; the kind that wear different colored caps and go about with
strange sabre cuts slanting across their manly faces.”

“There is a fine castle at Heidelberg, you know?” continued Sidney.

“So much the better; I like the combination of castles and colleges.”

“And the Black Forest practically begins there,” Sidney went on; “I
always did want to see that.”

“I am afraid you will hardly see the edge of it,” remarked Miss
Cavendish, “for I think we shall not linger long in Heidelberg. Not
that it isn’t a place in which we could linger satisfactorily, but
because it seems better to cover the ground more rapidly unless we have
an abundance of time.”

They arrived at the old university town late in the evening, and took
up their quarters on the pleasant Anlage. A concert was going on at the
Public Gardens and thither they started after supper, to the delight of
the girls, who realized that here would be a gathering of students and
townspeople, too. It was a quiet, orderly performance. Discreet young
women, properly chaperoned by smiling mammas, occupied chairs before
which bowed favored young men, who, with mamma’s consent, bore off the
damsels for a promenade while the music went on. Around and around
marched the slow procession; here were old men and maidens, young men
and children decorously pacing and talking quietly. Here were green
caps, blue caps, red caps, set upon locks of varied hues and above
seamed countenances which betokened that the wearer had participated
in an encounter which, to his thinking, added glory to his student
career. There was no disorder, no confusion, no undue hilarity. Before
the tables where they indulged in moderate draughts of beer, sat groups
of young men, elderly couples, or whole families. It was an interesting
sight to the Americans, who at last arose and said regretfully: “Where
at home could we sally forth by ourselves to an open-air concert where
beer drinking was the correct thing, and where good music could be
heard for such a modest sum as twelve cents? There are surely some
things it would be well to import, among them the delightful freedom
and comfort of cheap and respectable out-door entertainments.”

At the castle their enthusiasm grew in proportion as they climbed the
height. The day was one of June’s fairest, and the gardens were at
their loveliest. Below them nestled the houses of Heidelberg; beyond
wound the silver thread of the Neckar.

“What a beautiful garden one Elizabeth must have had,” said Sidney.
“Let me see. Do I remember rightly? The English building was built by
Frederick V. for his princess, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, and not long before the thirty years war,” Miss Cavendish
replied. “The oldest part of the castle dates from the fourteenth
century, and it was the residence of the Electors Palatine. Count
Palatine Otho of Wittelsbach, made the city the capital of his
territory in the thirteenth century, and for five hundred years it was
the principal town of the palatinate.”

“How dreadful that it should have been destroyed.”

“Yes, but what beautiful ruins these are,” said Gabriella. “I think
the castle is much more picturesque than if it were intact. Such a
tremendous place it was. To think that these thick, thick walls were
battered in.”

“I think it was wicked and barbarous, in spite of its having been left
a picturesque ruin,” said Sidney.

“We shall see other fine ruins on the Rhine,” said Miss Cavendish,
“but I doubt if any be more interesting than this. Now if you are all
sufficiently Baedeker-wise we will go back, and this afternoon we can
take the Philosophenweg.”

“Not too early,” said Sidney. “They say it is not so pleasant when the
sun is high.”

But they did start too early, and found it a hot and weary climb,
though the discovery of cherry gatherers at the top of the hill
somewhat compensated them for the long walk. For a few cents they
bargained for as much of the luscious fruit as they could eat, and they
sat down contentedly under the trees till the sun should sink lower and
render their way back less uncomfortably warm.

“We haven’t had really more than a glimpse of Heidelberg,” said Miss
Cavendish, “but I think it gives us a very good idea of the place. Are
you content with what you have seen?”

“Perfectly,” declared the girls, and Gabriella added: “When I make a
study of German I shall come here.”

“And to-morrow we go to Mayence and then on our Rhine trip,” said
Sidney. “We shall stay all night in Mayence, shall we?”

“Yes, there are some things worth seeing there, and we shall want all
day for the sail down the Rhine. At Mayence Gutenberg was born and
there the first printing office was set up. There is a very old and
interesting cathedral there, too, where the Tasso of Mayence is buried.”

“Who was he? Now I am interested,” said Gabriella.

“He was Count Heinrich von Meissen, surnamed Frauenlob, who during life
was calumniated and insulted, but whose body was borne to the grave by
the women whose praises he had sung. Mayence has many interesting pages
of history, and it is full of tradition and relics. Its citizens still
believe that it was in their city that Constantine the Great beheld his
vision of the Holy Cross.”

“Was Heidelberg named for its castle or was the castle named for the
city?” asked Sidney.

“It is said that the city takes its name from Heidelbeeren, or myrtles,
with which the castle hill was covered in the long ago days when it
was possessed by shepherds who led their flocks there.”

“And now there are flocks of students here nibbling in pastures of
knowledge and finding laurels instead of myrtles,” said Gabriella.

“That’s not bad, Gabriella,” said Miss Cavendish. “The town has been
five times bombarded, and burnt to the ground twice, while three times
it has been taken in war and plundered by soldiers, so you see there
are disadvantages in being too attractive.”

“I’d run the risk,” said Gabriella, “if I could be as attractive when I
am old.”

“What a threatening stronghold that castle must have been, perched
up so high above the town and overlooking the country around,” said
Sidney. “No wonder it was considered worthy of an enemy’s worst. When
was it besieged, Gem?”

“At the siege of Chantilly in 1693, but it was partially restored only
to be struck by lightning in 1764, since which time it has remained a
ruin.”

“When the baa-lambies stopped browsing on the hill, what came next?”
asked Gabriella.

“Next came the Romans, probably. After a while it grew to be a market
town and increased in importance as time went on. You remember
Longfellow’s description of the castle, don’t you? It is in ‘Hyperion,’
and of course you have read it.”

“I have of course, but those things don’t make half the impression
when one has not been to the spot. I shall read it with new interest.”

“There is much about Heidelberg in the tale. I forgot to tell you that
the university was founded in 1386.”

“The dates that I have swallowed this day,” said Gabriella. “I wish I
knew how to distinguish the student corps by their caps; there goes a
blue one.”

Miss Cavendish turned over the pages of her book. “The Prussians wear
white, the Westphalians green, the Vandals red, the Rhinelanders blue,
the Swabians yellow.”

“So it is a Rhinelander stalking down the hill there,” said Gabriella,
looking after the student. “Dear me, I am afraid I should soon get
perfectly fascinated with Heidelberg.”

“Then we must hurry away,” said Miss Cavendish, “for the interest
unfolds from hour to hour. The whole neighborhood seems to offer an
endless number of walks and drives, and the whole countryside bristles
with legends, so, lest we are tempted to stay here the rest of our
lives, we must start for Mayence.”

They arose from their seat under the leafy tree and returned to the
town to prepare for the next stage of their journey, and were in
Mayence the next day in time for dinner. They found this a pleasant
little town where excellent accommodations could be had at a small
hotel. A view of the cathedral, a walk along the fine quay by
the riverside occupied the few hours they had to spare before an
evening meal, and after that an open-air concert gave them all the
entertainment they needed.

“We certainly were not disappointed in Mayence,” said Gabriella as
their steamer was pushing out upon the Rhine the next morning. “That
was a good little hotel and they gave us excellent things to eat at a
very moderate price. I hope we shall not be disappointed in the Rhine;
so many persons are.”

“That is because they look for quantity rather than quality,” said Miss
Cavendish. “They expect to see a river as broad as the Mississippi, and
forget that it is beauty of scenery we are to look for. Between here
and Bonn we may expect to find the finest part of the river.”

“It is a glorious day and the world is very beautiful,” sighed
Gabriella, looking with increasing interest at the scene before her.

“I am going to get a little book of Rhine legends that I see over
there,” said Sidney. “It will help us to enjoy all this storied Rhine.”
The small book, purchased from an affable vendor of photographs,
guide-books and such like wares, proved to be rather an amusing
translation of the Rhine legends, but served the double purpose of
adding to the party’s information as well as to their hilarity. “The
poetry is the funniest I ever saw,” said Sidney, looking up from the
printed page. “Evidently the whole translation has been laboriously
made word by word from a dictionary. Listen to this:

  “‘He twirled a small staff in the air
    And unintelligibly talked--
    Appearing a Being of precipice rare
    As if from deep ravine he walked.’

Isn’t that perfectly delightful? Shouldn’t you love to see that kind of
being, Gabriella?”

“Here, here,” called Miss Cavendish, “you are missing all the beautiful
scenery while you are laughing over that nonsense. Leave that part for
a rainy day when you are pining for something to do.”

“This is one occasion when I should like to be wall-eyed,” said
Gabriella, “so I could look on both sides the river at once. While I
am gazing at some enchanting bit on the left, I am missing something I
ought to be looking at on the right.”

  “‘The castled crag of Drachenfels
    Frowns o’er the wide and winding Rhine,
    Whose breast of waters broadly swells
    Between the banks which bear the vine,’”

quoted Miss Cavendish, as they neared Rolandseck. “Just here, girls, I
think it is more beautiful than any point on the river that we have yet
seen.”

“Oh, isn’t it satisfactory!” cried Gabriella.

[Illustration: “‘HERE, HERE,’ CALLED MISS CAVENDISH, ‘YOU ARE MISSING
ALL THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY.’”]

“I wouldn’t have missed it for the world,” asserted Sidney. “Do
try to remember more of Byron’s beautiful poem. What is that about
‘chiefless castles breaking stern farewells?’ I wish we had a copy of
Byron. One ought to take a travelling library abroad; it is impossible
to go around laden down with books, yet you want them at every turn.
Are you feeling disappointed, Gem?”

“Not I. It meets my every expectation, and some day I mean to come to
Rolandseck and stay for a week to read Byron.”

“Then you have settled on Rolandseck as your favorite spot along the
river?”

“Yes, I think so, for it commands the Drachenfels, the Siebengebirge
and the mountain of Rolandseck where poor lovelorn Roland built his
castle. It seems to me that here the beauty of the river culminates,
and some day I should like to come back to it when I could take time
for an intimate acquaintance with the neighborhood. What scores of
tales and legends swarm into one’s memory just here. It is here
that one discovers the inspiration of Wagner’s operas, which can be
understood how much better after seeing these renowned castles and
famous cliffs.”

Beyond Bonn the scenery became tamer, and by the time they had reached
Cologne they did not regret that they must leave the steamer. A glimpse
only of the cathedral was all the evening light afforded them, but
this was sufficient to cause them to speak in whispers as they issued
from the splendid interior. “We can walk around and see the outside,
anyhow,” said Sidney. “I want to take in every detail, for it is the
most beautiful thing I ever imagined in the way of architecture. I
am glad the windows of our room at the hotel give us a view of those
magnificent towers. It has been a wonderful day, Gem; that lovely
Rhine, and now this.”

“And we will end it with a garden concert,” said Miss Cavendish. “One
can always be sure of good music in Germany, wherever one goes.”

But they did not dream that one of their most treasured memories would
be connected with their evening in the Flora Gardens, to which they
were directed by the urbane proprietor of their hotel. A good concert
might be expected, they were told, and they would enjoy the gardens
themselves. The long twilight made it possible for them to reach the
place before dark, and it was nine o’clock before the darkness began to
gather over the beautiful garden. The shadowy walks and lovely vistas
so invited them that at the first intermission they left their places
to wander down the paths beyond which were softly plashing fountains
and blossoming plants.

They had sauntered quite away from the groups of persons who were
lounging along the broader walks and had come to a quiet, lonely
spot shaded by overhanging boughs of densest leafage. Suddenly from
the midst of this bosky grove came a note of marvellous purity, then
another, and presently such a song of marvellous sweetness fell upon
their ears as held them spellbound.

“Is it a nightingale?” whispered Gabriella.

Miss Cavendish nodded an assent.

Sidney stood with eyes full of tears. Gabriella clasped her hands
tensely and looked up into the deeply green branches where the songster
had made his retreat. Not a word was said while the bird trilled out
his notes of ecstasy. The concert which they had come to hear was
forgotten. They stood in mute delight while the song burst forth from
time to time. Silence, and then a repetition of the glorious song in
all its fulness; it seemed as if the little creature’s heart must burst
with the rapture of it, and to those who listened it was as if it came
from no earthly being but that it was a voice from Paradise. At last it
ceased, and the three, after listening in vain for a repetition, caught
only a distant echo of the song and they walked quietly away.

“Let us go home,” said Sidney. “I don’t want to hear the rest of the
concert. That nightingale’s song is enough for one evening.”

“It was the most exquisitely delicious thing I ever listened to,”
Gabriella said. “Oh, Gem, who could have dreamed that we, who listened
in vain for a nightingale in Italy, should have found one here? What
a red-letter day it has been! That beautiful Rhine, that wonderful
cathedral, that heavenly song! It has been almost too much; I feel as
if I should like to creep off somewhere in this garden and weep.”

“That would be such a typically German thing to do,” laughed Miss
Cavendish. “You haven’t said _wunderschoen_ once, but your desire
to shed tears in this garden would satisfy even Jean Paul who might
address you something like this: ‘Thou sweet one! Thou of the tender
heart and tearful eyes! that rapturous song has broken the fountain
of thy youth with its melody and thy soul gushes forth in sparkling
drops!’”

“Stop making fun of Jean Paul,” cried Gabriella. “You are ready to cry
yourself, and are ashamed of it, and that is why you speak so lightly.”

“That is about the truth, Rella,” returned Miss Cavendish soberly. “It
has been a day of sheer delight to me as well as to you, but I can’t
afford to be too sentimental when I have two romantic maidens gazing at
me with such languishing eyes.”

The cathedral by morning light was even more beautiful than at evening.
The wonderful coloring of the stained glass against the greyish white
of the stonework seemed then more effective.

“No wonder it has been so many years in building,” remarked Sidney.
“The exact date of its commencement is 1248, I find, but for a long
time no work was done upon it.”

“It is hardly possible to conceive of the magnificence of its
proportions,” observed Miss Cavendish. “I cannot realize that it is
four hundred feet long and that the towers are five hundred feet high.”

“I want to know the legend of St. Ursula and of the Theban legion,”
Gabriella said.

“You surely haven’t forgotten the story of St. Ursula and the eleven
thousand virgins. We looked that up in Italy.”

“So we did. Yes, I remember now.”

“The martyrs of the Theban legion were Christians who, with the rest
of the Roman army, crossed the Alps. They were ordered by Maximilian
to sacrifice to Jupiter, but this they refused to do, and the command
was given for every tenth man to be slain. This order was repeated at
every refusal of the remaining members of the legion to join in the
sacrificial rite, till only a very few were left; these escaped and
became hermits.”

“Speaking of legends,” remarked Gabriella, “I forgot to call your
attention to the funniest bit of writing I have seen yet. It beats
your Rhine legends, Sidney. It hangs in my room at the hotel where you
can see it for yourselves and prove the truth of my copy. The lack of
punctuation agrees with the original. It is one of the curiosities
which I shall take home with me.” And she produced a paper which read:
“To open and close the electrical on is requested to turn to the right
hand when going to bed it must be closed otherwise the lightning must
be paid.”

A chorus of laughter went up after the reading of this remarkable
notice. “I’ve been wondering ever since where one finds the lightning
which must be paid,” Gabriella informed the other two. “Do you suppose
they keep it bottled up in a sort of office and make a fetish of it,
and that one goes in and desposits a mark as a sacrificial offering, or
something like that?”

“It is the loveliest bit of English we have yet discovered,” Sidney
averred. “I must have a copy of it. Cologne has certainly afforded
us plenty of laughter if her cathedral does silence us and if her
nightingale does move us to tears.”




CHAPTER XI

THREE HUNDRED WINDMILLS


Two rooms high up in a modest little hotel just off the “Dam” were
considered satisfactory quarters for the three travellers who arrived
in Amsterdam late one evening in early June. “The rooms have the
advantage of facing the street and of being off to themselves,” said
Miss Cavendish, viewing them complacently, “and I am sure they are
very cheap, though I have always heard that in Holland one must expect
to pay high prices for everything. To be sure this doesn’t compare
with what one gets in Italy for the same money, but it is much better
than I expected. We get our breakfast at the hotel, our dinner in the
restaurant below and our luncheon wherever we happen to be.”

“I like that arrangement,” responded Gabriella; “it gives a pleasing
variety, and is quite different from any process of living that we have
indulged in.” She was perched upon the broad window-sill in their room,
looking down upon the street. Miss Cavendish was occupied in unpacking
her small trunk, and Sidney, in the next room, was absorbed in her
letters which she found awaiting her. “Do you know what I find rather
remarkable?” continued Gabriella, after watching the passers-by for
some minutes. “Here in Amsterdam the people remind me of Americans. In
Italy one expects to see the Latin type prevailing; in Germany one has
no difficulty in realizing that he is running up against the Teuton
race; in Switzerland there is no mistaking the fact that you are in a
foreign country, but if I were to fall asleep in New York and were to
wake up in Amsterdam I should never know that I had crossed the seas
unless I looked up at the houses, or happened to catch sight of a woman
with gilt bed-springs over her ears, or a gold plate under her cap. So
far as the actual physiognomy is concerned they might as well be my own
townsmen.”

“That is rather interesting.” Miss Cavendish looked up from a small
work-box she was emptying into her lap. “I can’t think what I did with
those buttons. I’ll come and join you, Gabriella, and pursue this study
of mankind, just as soon as I can find that big pearl button that
belongs to my grey shirt-waist. Where could I have put it?”

“It’s in that little box where you keep your cuff-pins,” Gabriella
told her. “I saw them there when I upset the box the other day. Hurry
up, Gem, this is a fine place for observing the world of Amsterdam.
To be sure we are rather high up in that world, and can only get a
bird’s-eye view, but it is entertaining to look down on the people,
and across at the long narrow houses with their gable ends toward
the street; then there are the domes and cupolas and clock towers to
see. Listen to those carillons. That’s the word, isn’t it? Aren’t
they fascinating? That is one thing that impresses me over here: the
wonderful chiming of the bells. Shall you ever forget how they sounded
in Florence? They seem to ring out history every hour. Yes, this isn’t
a bad location, though I am rather sorry we are not right on a canal;
still this is very convenient. Where to-morrow, Gem?”

“To the Museum, I think, unless you would rather explore some of
the little places near by; there are ever so many of them: Zaandam,
Monnikendam, Volendam, Broek, Marken.”

“Let’s take Amsterdam first and sandwich the other places between,
though I must say I am wild to see more of the windmills and dikes that
we caught sight of as we came along.”

“I think then it would be rather a good plan to take the cloudy days
for Amsterdam and the bright ones for the outside places, as this is
not sunny Italy, and we may expect rain at any time.”

“We certainly don’t want to visit Marken in the rain,” remarked Sidney,
coming in, “and yet we do want to see Amsterdam to the best advantage.”

“We’ll go to the Museum to-morrow, then, and trust to luck for the
next day,” Miss Cavendish decided.

“We must have a good, clear and large map,” she announced, as they
started forth the next morning. “The one in the guide book is rather
small, and Amsterdam is not so simply laid out as some of the other
cities. All these canals are bewildering.” The map was secured, and
they triumphantly started off to find their way on foot to the Rijks
Museum. It was a cool morning; a stiff breeze was blowing, reminding
them of their proximity to the sea; over the sky flying clouds were
scudding, though the sun was shining, and the city had that clean,
newly washed look that seaside cities are likely to present. At
the first corner Miss Cavendish opened her map in order to get her
bearings. The map was larger than she had supposed, being not smaller
than a newspaper’s double sheet, and it took the three to hold it down,
for the fresh breeze flapped it in their faces, and threatened to
carry it off bodily. As the three heads were bent studiously over the
labyrinthine lines designed to show streets and canals, the attention
of passers-by was arrested. Here were strangers in difficulty, and the
kindly spirit of two or three was disturbed. One of them approached.
“Did they speak Dutch?”

“No.” Each stranger shook her head.

Perhaps French. The speaker knew a little. Therefore in French they
made known their dilemma. The shortest way to the Rijks Museum
was what they wished to discover. The young man gave them careful
directions. They were to follow the street, upon which they were, to
a certain corner, then turn off till they came to the Park Hotel, and
they would then have no trouble in finding the Museum.

They thanked their informant and started off again valiantly, feeling
quite sure of their way, but they had gone only a short distance, the
length perhaps of two or three blocks, when Miss Cavendish looked
around with a puzzled expression. “I am afraid that we are off the
track,” she said hesitatingly. “We seem to be going around in a circle.
You know these streets and canals do follow a horse-shoe curve. I think
we’d better look at the map again before we go further.” Therefore the
map was again unfolded to the breeze and upon its flapping surface Miss
Cavendish tried to outline their road.

They were still engaged in a discussion over it, and were anxiously
looking up and down the street, when Sidney clutched Miss Cavendish.
“Here he comes,” she cried.

“Who? Who?” asked both the others.

“The young man who showed us the way. Put up the map. Let him think
we have stopped to tie our shoes or that we are interested in the
architecture of this building--anything.”

A tumultuous effort was made to fold up the map, but in the strong wind
it proved itself an obstreperous offender, and was only too plainly
in evidence when the young man stepped smilingly up to them. There was
no explanation to be made. Their flag of distress was obvious in the
flapping map. It was only too apparent that they had again lost their
way, and when the young Dutchman politely offered to pilot them they
meekly accepted his escort.

“But we shall be taking you out of your way, and using your valuable
time,” expostulated Miss Cavendish, as it became evident that he did
not mean to lose sight of them till they had reached the very doors of
the Museum.

“I am not too busy to do the honors of my city,” returned their guide.
“Some day I may be in your New York and then I shall be very glad if
one of your countrymen will show me the way.” And at the suggested
compensation they had nothing to say except to declare that if it might
fall to their lot, hereafter, to pilot any Dutchman through the mazes
of New York streets, they would do it gratefully. With a few parting
directions the young man left them at their destination, and they soon
became absorbed in the treasures displayed.

“I had no idea that I should like the old Dutch masters so well,”
said Gabriella, pausing before a fine Rembrandt. “I fancied an array
of burgomasters and juffrouws, painted in a very low key, would not
specially appeal to me, but they are wonderful. Look at those hands;
they are so carefully studied and yet they are painted broadly.”

“You may notice that all these Dutch painters were careful of their
drawing,” Miss Cavendish drew attention to the fact.

“I don’t care particularly for their subjects. This large gathering of
worthy members of guilds isn’t so very interesting. I prefer the miles
of saints in the Italian galleries.” Sidney signified the pictures with
a comprehensive wave of the hand.

“I must confess I like the Dutchmen,” Gabriella maintained, “and I like
Franz Hals particularly. Of course the ‘Night Watch’ is magnificent;
no one can dispute that, but somehow it seems to me that Franz Hals
combines the best qualities of the old school and the modern. There
is nothing photographic about his work, and yet it doesn’t look
like a crazy quilt, though it is broadly enough painted to suit an
impressionist. If I had belonged to the honorable guild of cap-makers,
or apron-wearers, I should have had Franz Hals paint my portrait when
I was young, and when I became a dear old mutterkin in a cap I should
have preferred Rembrandt; nobody ever painted old women as he did.”

The clouds which had overclouded the sky when they started forth in the
morning, now fulfilled their promise of rain, and a steady downpour had
set in; therefore they concluded to take luncheon in the restaurant
attached to the Museum and to continue their examination of the many
objects of interest at hand.

“This Museum is a nice, safe, dry place,” said Miss Cavendish, “and I
think we may as well browse around here the rest of the day. There is
some beautiful old furniture to see.”

“And that queer collection of Dutch national costumes on life-size
figures; we must be sure not to miss that,” suggested Sidney.

“It was a day well spent,” Miss Cavendish uttered the words as they
climbed the steep stairway to their rooms, “but oh, I am tired,” she
added, “and I am thankful we have no further to go than downstairs for
our dinner.”

“I wonder whether all the Dutchmen are as good-natured and polite as
our little guide,” said Gabriella, gazing out of the window at the wet
street. “He certainly did exhibit the kindliest interest in us. Imagine
finding anyone in our rushing America who would take the time to do
such a favor for a party of strangers. They are busy here, but they
are deliberate in the matter of business, and the respite from rush is
refreshing. I wonder if we shall have seven kinds of cheese for dinner,
Gem?”

“Did you like the breakfast?”

“Yes; it was a change from the usual Continental breakfast. The coffee
was the best I have tasted since I left home, and the butter was
delicious, but from such an array of cold meats and cheese it was hard
to choose, and I ended up by sampling so many kinds of cheese that I
was rather unhappy for an hour afterward. I suppose it was too fresh
for American digestion. I’ll abstain next time.”

“Amsterdam is rather fascinating, don’t you think?” questioned Sidney,
joining Gabriella at the window. “It must be the canals that make it
so, at least it is partly that. It is something like Venice in having
so many waterways, though it is really not a bit like it, for here the
streets provide a road on each side the canals and a waterway down
the middle, while in Venice we rarely had even a sidewalk; it was all
water.”

“That flower market that we saw this morning was beautiful,” observed
Gabriella; “all those bright flowers in the canal boats reflected in
the water, and the long shady street. It must be the trees, Sid, that
make the difference; there are so many here, and in Venice scarcely
any. For a summer day what pleasanter combination than cool looking
grey and white houses, and shaded streets with a canal down the middle.
Yes, I am quite in love with Amsterdam.”

The weather did not clear before noon the next day, and the
contemplated trip to Marken was deferred, but Zaandam was discovered
to be possible, and they complacently sallied forth, Sidney bearing
her camera, and Gabriella insisting upon conveying a huge loaf of
gingerbread. “You know Amsterdam is celebrated for its gingerbread,”
she remarked, as she issued from the bake-shop with her package. “They
wouldn’t cut this, and so I had to buy it all, but it was very cheap,
and after looking at those three hundred windmills this afternoon, we
shall probably need something fortifying. If we can’t eat it all to-day
we can save the rest for to-morrow. This sharp sea air gives me an
appetite.”

“So I have observed,” remarked Sidney.

Gabriella laughed and they started for the little steamer which was to
take them to their destination. Sidney found abundant opportunity for
using her camera as they proceeded upon their slow way. “Holland is so
nice and flat,” she observed, “and the air is so clear that I am sure
my Holland views will turn out well, whatever my Italian ones may do.”

“And we are not pestered to death with beggars here,” remarked Miss
Cavendish, as they stepped ashore. But here they were beset by cabmen,
who persistently followed them and used every persuasion to induce them
to take a drive to see the three hundred windmills. Finding that their
repeated refusals did no good, the ladies walked rapidly away, though
one individual, more pertinacious than the rest, did not cease his
importunity, but kept behind them at hailing distance.

“He actually is getting on my nerves,” said Gabriella at last. “If
he didn’t speak English we could shut our ears and pretend he was
talking about the weather. Let us cut through one of these little side
places and see if we can’t get rid of him.” So they made a sudden turn
and slipped out of sight to find themselves upon a picturesque street
intersected by little canals. Smiling Dutch children played before the
doors, cleanly housewives scoured and scrubbed their brass vessels in
the _schloats_.

“This is ideal,” said Sidney focusing her camera upon a specially
pleasing group. But she had not time to take a snap-shot before
Gabriella cried, “There he comes!” and she looked to see the form of
their tormentor bearing down upon them. Gabriella fairly took to her
heels, leaving the others to add another dignified refusal to those
already given.

They found Gabriella laughing behind the palings of a fence which
enclosed a small garden where she had taken refuge. “Did you get rid of
him?” she inquired, “or is the avenger still upon our track? I really
didn’t feel that I could face him again. Isn’t this an interesting
place? Such pretty gardens and such clean houses. Somewhere about
here is the cottage where Peter the Great lived when he was learning
ship-building; I caught sight of it as I came along. That nice,
rosy-cheeked, fat little boy, in the wooden shoes, will tell us where
it is. When we have seen it we will try to escape through another
street so we shall not have to pass the tormenter again. I know he is
lying in wait for us.”

Miss Cavendish laughed. “Gabriella has really a panic. I think it is
rather funny myself. I don’t in the least mind saying no whenever it is
necessary.”

“Ah, but you have had chances to say no so much oftener than I,”
complained Gabriella. The rosy-cheeked child who stood staring at them
could not withstand the smile which she gave him and, after accepting
a large piece of the gingerbread, he pointed the way to the cottage of
Peter the Great.

A circuitous route took them to the other end of the quiet clean town
where scrubbing and scouring were going on incessantly, outside the
small houses. Windmills flung around their arms in every direction; in
the lush green meadows beyond the town neat black and white cows were
quietly grazing; groups of blue-aproned, tow-headed children frolicked
unrestrained in the streets. Everyone appeared serenely content.

“It is just as placidly Dutch as I believed it would be,” began
Gabriella. “Now, if we can get back to the boat without being
importuned to take a drive--”

“Ladies, you will just have time for a ride around the town to see
the three hundred windmills before your boat goes,” said a voice at
her elbow. She gave a little surprised scream and dashed on, leaving
Miss Cavendish so full of laughter that she could scarcely rebuff the
persistent man who cheerfully travelled along within a few feet of her
to the very door of the waiting-room.

“If only he wouldn’t speak English,” groaned Gabriella, “and if he
wouldn’t have that way with him as if he fully meant to keep up his
arguments until we actually had to give in, I wouldn’t care. When he
startled me by that last appearance every hair on my head began to
rise. What did you say, Sidney?”

“I said that this is the wrong landing. We came down on that steamer
that is waiting on the other side. Evidently the first-class steamers
come in at one wharf and the second-class at the other.”

“Oh, then if this is second-class let us go from here. I don’t mind, do
you? Anything rather than cross that bridge again.”

“But our tickets aren’t for this line,” explained Miss Cavendish.

“Oh!” Gabriella meekly gave in and they essayed to return. But just as
they reached the end of the bridge there stood their man. He pointed
in triumph to the steamer now slowly leaving her dock. “You’ll not get
your steamer, ladies,” he said. “There will not be another leaving for
an hour, and you’ll just have time for a--” Gabriella stopped her ears
and ran on wildly, not stopping till she was safe at the pier.

“I really couldn’t hear him mention those three hundred windmills
again,” she declared. “We are safe now, for no one can come inside
the gates without a ticket and we shall have a lovely time taking
photographs and eating our gingerbread.” But the delectable food
disproved its appearance, for it was by no means as good as it looked.
“And I thought it was going to be delicious,” said Gabriella, looking
ruefully at the large supply she had bought. “We can’t eat it; I can’t
bear to throw it away, and I don’t believe there are any poor people in
Holland; I haven’t seen any who couldn’t make better gingerbread than
this. I wish I had tasted it at once and then I could have given it to
the goat we saw at the other end of the town. Nothing but a goat could
make way with this.”

“Leave it on the bench when we go,” suggested Sidney, “and then you
will not know what becomes of it.”

“That is a good idea,” returned Gabriella. But she was not permitted
to follow out her plan, for upon stepping upon the gangplank a workman
perceived the package, rushed back and politely handed it to her. She
gave him a weak “Thank you,” and cast upon her friends such a look as
made them laugh every time they recalled it. “Perhaps they don’t have
gingerbread at Marken,” Gabriella had a sudden inspiration. “I will
take it down there to-morrow and give it to some youngster.” Even this
privilege was denied her, for she forgot it in the hurry of getting
off, and the final disposition of the gingerbread was never settled,
for they left it upon the table when at last they took their departure
from their rooms.

“Marken was rather disappointing,” Miss Cavendish gave her opinion as
they set out upon their return from this far-famed island the next day.
“It is so evidently a show place nowadays. The people pose for effect,
and even the rapturous woman who threw her arms around us when we told
her we were Americans, was simply a good actress.”

“But the littlest of the boys and girls do still dress exactly alike,”
asserted Gabriella, who did not wish her illusions to vanish, “and they
do have a queer costume.”

“And their cottages are most interesting, I am sure,” Sidney agreed
with Gabriella. “And the little caps I bought are genuine. I did want
to get those so I could show them to grandfather. I shall have to label
them at once before I forget whether it is the round patch on the back
or the square one which is for the boys.”

“It is a desolate place, that island,” Miss Cavendish went on. “I
shouldn’t like to live there in winter.”

“But Monnikendam is dear,” said Sidney. “I simply love that sleepy old
place.”

“And Broek is exactly like Spotless Town,” continued Gabriella.

“We must go to Alkmaar on market day,” decided Miss Cavendish. “I fancy
there we shall see more costumes, and get an idea of the people more
satisfactorily than by taking these special excursions, which I am
sure the fisher folk prepare for. I suppose if we were to seek out the
unfrequented villages there would still be much in Holland which would
appeal to us.”

“I think we have been able to get an excellent idea of Holland in the
little while we have been here,” Sidney assured her.

“We might stay another day, perhaps, if you have seen enough of
_schloats_ and windmills and all that. We can take in The Hague on our
way to Antwerp.”

This was agreed upon and then, with a distinct recollection of the
quality of the gingerbread in a certain bake-shop and of the fact that
there were three hundred windmills in Zaandam, they sought their beds.




CHAPTER XII

A TEMPEST IN AN INK-BOTTLE


“I had no idea we should find Antwerp so interesting,” said Sidney
a few days later. “Holland I expected to be all that it proved; a
fascinating place where one would like to spend an entire summer.”

“And where they charge more for laundry work than any place within my
experience,” replied Miss Cavendish, looking up from her accounts;
“though as for the rest of our expenses, they fell far below what I
was given to suppose. Our week here has cost us about thirteen dollars
apiece; that includes our little side trips and our tickets to Antwerp.”

“It doesn’t seem possible that it could be done so cheaply,” returned
Sidney, who never could understand how Miss Cavendish managed to keep
their expenses within the limit she had set for them.

“If it were anyone else but our clever Gem who was our personal
conductor,” said Gabriella, “it could not be done. It is because we
have her and because we don’t go to the caravansaries.”

“And because we buy such cheap gingerbread,” added Sidney, slyly.

“Oh, now--” Gabriella began.

“There is a little suggestion of French life here,” Miss Cavendish
went on, not heeding these side remarks. “It isn’t quite as sedate as
Amsterdam. I agree with you, Sidney, that there is much to attract one.”

“Including this excellent _pension_ with its pretty little garden.”

“And its funny milk-carts with those dear, good, hard-working dogs to
draw them,” continued Gabriella.

“It is really a very important city, historically, commercially and
artistically,” Miss Cavendish went on. “We shall find plenty of Rubens’
pictures here, his masterpieces, too. The cathedral is specially rich
in paintings, and there is a remarkable carved pulpit there which we
must not forget to see. St. Jacques is also a splendid church; the
stained glass there is remarkably good. You see I have informed myself
upon the sights of the city.”

“What shall we find at the Academy?” asked Gabriella.

“Rubens, and still more Rubens, with a number of other examples of good
work.”

“Then I foresee that we shall spend several days here very
satisfactorily,” Sidney predicted.

Time proved the truth of this, for it was the end of the week before
they were ready to leave Antwerp’s interesting streets, where quaint
old shops crowding splendid churches lured them to purchase precious
laces, rare old silver, and fascinating antiques of all kinds.

[Illustration: “‘IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT CITY, HISTORICALLY,
COMMERCIALLY AND ARTISTICALLY.’”]

“I shall not have a penny left for Paris if I keep on,” sighed
Gabriella, “and there is Brussels yet to be considered.”

“But you may not want to spend anything there,” Sidney comforted her by
saying. “I am told that one gets better laces here for the money, and
that it is all a delusion that Paris prices do not obtain in Brussels.
It may have been so at one time, but unless you know just where to go
you can do better in Paris.”

“There are a dozen places it would be worth while to visit,” remarked
Miss Cavendish, when they were on their way to Brussels, “but as long
as we are simply skimming the cream very lightly, we shall have to
leave them out. There are Treves and Bruges, for example, I should
like much to see them. Treves is probably the oldest city this side
the Alps, and claims to be older than Rome. Its history is exceedingly
interesting. Bruges is a fine old city, too, full of things we would
like to see.”

“Some day in my Methuselah incarnation,” announced Gabriella, “I shall
come to Europe and visit all the small, no ’count towns. I think we
could find a great many curious things in some of the places which
nobody ever hears of, and which the guide-books pass over. Antwerp is
not lacking in pleasant things to hear about. I like the story of
Quentin Matsys, who gave up his trade of blacksmith in order to become
an artist and marry an artist’s daughter. One never knows what hidden
treasures may lie under ‘hodden grey.’ That blue blouse yonder may
cover the heart of a poet.”

“I liked that about the five hundred New Testaments, and all that
about Tyndale, who sold his whole edition to the Bishop of London and
paid his debts, and then when the bishop had burned the books Tyndale
promptly brought out a more perfect edition. I always like to hear of
those wily old political tyrants being outwitted. What story did you
like best, Gem?”

“I think the legend of St. Genoveva of Treves is delightful, though
that takes us some distance from Antwerp. You remember that she was
banished to the woods by the intrigues of Golo, Siegfried’s steward,
and there her little boy was born, whom she named Sorrowful. His
woodland nurse was a gentle hind. After seven years Siegfried and his
friends were out hunting, and pursued the hind, whom they started up
from her covert. When at last they came up to it they found a lovely
boy standing closely clasping the creature’s neck. Then a fair woman
appeared, whom Siegfried recognized as his beloved and wronged wife.
She was able to vindicate herself from the charges of unfaithfulness
which Golo had caused to be made against her and was restored to her
husband. After her death she was canonized.”

“That is a pretty tale,” agreed Sidney.

“Brussels is so modern that we shall have to go on a pilgrimage in
order to find its ancient streets, I fancy.” Gabriella expressed this
opinion as they bowled along the wide boulevards of the city.

“We shall not have to go far,” Miss Cavendish told her, “for the Grand
Place where the Hotel de Ville stands is the very centre of historical
interest.”

“We’ll go there first thing, then, shall we? What do you most care to
see, Gabriella?”

“Her beauty and her chivalry. There is some of the beauty, in that
carriage. And oh, what a fine building. What is it?” She put her query
to the driver.

“Le Palais de Justice,” he told her.

“We must not fail to go there. I begin to observe that Brussels, like
most of the other spots we have visited, is worth while.” And it was
several days before the sights of the upper and lower town had been
viewed, even hastily. The cathedral with its magnificent stained glass;
the Palais de la Nation; the Hotel de Ville, where they happened to
be in time to witness a grand wedding; the Bois de la Cambre, where
they sat and listened to the band play while they observed fashion in
carriages and the rest of the world on foot; these were but a few of
the things that occupied their attention.

Miss Cavendish, as usual, was fascinated by the laces, and, having
discovered a little shop where moderate prices prevailed, she was
beguiled into adding to her purchases an extremely beautiful bertha.

“Um! Um!” exclaimed Gabriella, when it was displayed to her envious
eyes, “I’d like to be the fellow to wear that.”

“Perhaps you will be,” returned her godmother.

“Why, Isabella Cavendish, what do you mean? Explain yourself, if you
please.”

“I mean that I am buying this for a wedding present. It shall be for
the first one of the party who requires it for a wedding gown.”

“Lovely!” exclaimed Gabriella. “I’ll try my best to be the one who
earns it.”

“Oh, dear, I didn’t mean to set a premium on marrying; that wasn’t my
idea at all. I only thought of its being a suggestive gift for one of
you girls when the time came, because of the association. Lace will
keep, you know, and I am in no hurry to get rid of it, I assure you.”

Gabriella looked at the delicate point with longing eyes. “I don’t
intend to let you have it, Sid,” she declared, “for you can afford to
buy slathers of lace for your wedding gown, while I shall never have
another chance like this.”

Sidney laughed. “How terribly in earnest the child is,” she said. “I’ll
tell you what we can do, Rella, we’ll make the compact that it is to
be worn by each of us. Whoever has it first will lend it to the others
as the occasion requires.”

“Others?” exclaimed Miss Cavendish. “Please leave me out of the
question.”

“Indeed we will not,” Sidney spoke with decision. “I prophesy that you
will be the very first to require it.”

“It is a lovely scheme,” Gabriella agreed, “and as I intend to marry
nothing less than an American multi-millionaire or a wealthy Birmingham
manufacturer with a bran-new title, it will be I who shall need it
first.”

“We’ll not quarrel over it,” said Miss Cavendish, laughing as she
returned the lace to its wrappings. “This is positively my last
purchase of lace for this trip. Please bear me witness, girls.”

Although Brussels’ attractions continued to occupy their time, the
prospect of Paris absorbed their thoughts and they suddenly decided to
set their faces toward the “American heaven.”

“I have sensations, distinct sensations,” Gabriella announced. “My
hands are cold and there are creepy feelings running up and down my
spine. In five minutes we shall be in Paris, with the Latin quarter
contiguous, so to speak, and the Louvre within comfortable distance.”

“I hope your creepy feelings don’t mean that you have taken cold,”
remarked Miss Cavendish, practically.

“Oh, dear, no; they are purely mental effects. There, we have stopped.
Do you dare get out, Gem, and project yourself into the hands of a
Parisian cab-driver? I am scared to death of them and don’t dare to
lift my eyelids till we get fairly started out of the station. Have
we everything? Oh!” This last exclamation was due to the fact that
Miss Cavendish was interviewing a respectable-looking interpreter,
who agreed for the sum of one franc to put their luggage through the
customs, get them a cab and see them safely started for the proper
address.

“It is worth double the amount to be freed from responsibility,”
acknowledged Miss Cavendish, who, on this occasion, was a little
nervous. “I have something the feeling that Daniel must have had when
he entered the lions’ den. I wonder if we shall ever have the courage
to venture into the streets of Paris alone.”

“We have done it everywhere else,” Gabriella rejoined, “and we have
never been gobbled up.”

“I suppose it is exceedingly silly and provincial to feel as if Paris
were more dangerous than any other city, and no doubt I shall recover
my equilibrium as soon as I get my bearings,” Miss Cavendish assured
her charges. “Don’t lose faith in me, girls, because I employed an
interpreter.”

“It would take more than a dozen interpreters to make us lose faith in
you,” they insisted, loyally.

“It is beautiful. It isn’t in the least disappointing,” Gabriella
exclaimed suddenly. “We are coming to the fine part of the city. This
must be the Champs Élysées. There is the Arc d’Étoile, isn’t it? Are we
to be near that, then?”

“I think so,” returned Miss Cavendish, a little uncertainly. “Yes, this
is our street,” as they turned off the great thoroughfare.

“Good! Then we shall see the driving and the crowds and all that.”

“But you must remember that the gay season is over and what we shall
see of Paris will not be the fashion and the show of spring and autumn.”

“We shall see enough, no doubt,” returned Gabriella, nothing
discouraged.

Madame, their landlady, was a typical Frenchwoman, who greeted them in
voluble French and assigned them their rooms with a business-like air.
The rooms were not large, but were comfortable and looked out upon a
long green court. “This is better than I could have believed,” asserted
Miss Cavendish. “I rather inclined toward the Luxembourg quarter till
Miss Bailey advised me to come here, for, as she said, the air is
better and it will be cooler in case we have hot weather. I suppose we
should perhaps see more of the life of the streets on the other side
of the city, but, upon the whole, I am inclined to think that we have
chosen wisely.”

“At least,” said Sidney, “we have not five or six long flights to
climb, for this is only the second floor from the street.”

Gabriella was reading a note which the maid had just brought her. “The
Baileys have arrived,” she remarked.

“How did you find that out?” Sidney asked in surprise.

“From this note,” returned Gabriella.

“Miss Bailey is writing to you? What for?”

“I didn’t say the note was from Miss Bailey,” replied Gabriella,
blushing furiously.

“Gabriella, Gabriella, remember the multi-millionaire, or the
Birmingham manufacturer,” warned Sidney. But Gabriella only laughed and
thrust the note inside her blouse.

Sidney looked at her suspiciously. “You let that Briton know when and
where we were coming,” she said.

“Well, not exactly as you put it,” Gabriella made reply. “He wrote
to ask,--that was when we were in Antwerp,--and I answered when it
was decided that we should be here the first of this week, and I
furthermore told him that we were coming to a house recommended by
Miss Bailey. I didn’t suppose I should find a note here, though it was
natural enough, as he is not three squares away.”

“For pity’s sake,” exclaimed Miss Cavendish. “Is this to be a
repetition of Florence, Gabriella? What is the object of his writing to
you?”

“He wants us all to go to the Salon with him. It will be open only a
few days longer, and he wanted me to know that. I am sure it is very
decent of him.”

“So it is,” returned Miss Cavendish, somewhat mollified, “but I do
hope, Gabriella, that you will not lead that young man a dance.”

“Oh, bless you, no. We are on very good terms with England, so there is
no reason why I should try to revenge myself for any of the offences of
his forefathers. I don’t bear any grudge because of taxation without
representation.”

“But you simply cannot help flirting.”

“Oh yes, I can; I have helped it on occasions.”

“Then let this be one of the occasions.”

Gabriella looked up at her with a little inscrutable smile and set
to work to arrange her belongings. During this process she placed a
travelling ink-bottle upon the table which stood directly in front of
the window and upon a level with the sill. In reaching for something
upon the other side of the table the bottle was overturned, and before
anyone could rescue it, over it fell, rolled out, and dropped with a
crash into the court below, breaking into fragments. The effect was
electrifying. In an instant there was excited voices raised above and
below stairs; heads were thrust from the windows; the concierge, with
angry gesticulations, consulted his wife; even a gendarme appeared to
add to the general excitement.

“Did they think it was dynamite, or what?” questioned Gabriella in
dismay.

At this instant there was a peremptory knock at the door. A maid, with
flustered manner and red face, appeared. Madame wished to know the
occasion of the disaster. How did it happen?

Each with the best French that she could summon tried to explain. It
was an accident; the bottle had rolled out, they tried to tell her. Had
anyone been hurt? Was any damage done?

“No, they were assured, but--” Here came a long speech spoken in such
rapid utterance that they could not exactly follow, nor could they
gather why the matter should so stir up the whole household. The maid
was evidently not satisfied, for she took herself off still talking.

Presently another appeared. This one was English. Madame wished to know
where the bottle was standing when the accident occurred. Had it been
placed upon the window-sill?

“No, no,” returned Miss Cavendish, “it was upon the table. As you can
see, it is very easy for anything to roll out.”

“Ah-h!” A smile of satisfaction overspread Betty’s face. Then it was
all right. Perhaps the ladies did not know that it was against the
law to place anything upon the window-sill, in case of danger to the
passers-by. She would explain.

She withdrew and the report was taken to those below, the
gesticulating and red-faced concierge subsided; the interested
bystanders who had congregated slouched back into the street; the heads
disappeared from the windows, and all was serene again.

“Did you ever know such a tempest in an ink-bottle?” exclaimed Sidney.
“One would suppose that we had at least made an attempt to blow up the
Louvre, or had tried to assassinate the president, and all because an
ink-bottle fell out of the window.”

“Yes, but isn’t it French to get so excited over it?” laughed Miss
Cavendish. “As soon as they discovered that we had not flagrantly
broken a law, the circumstance ceased to interest them.”

“All the same, with their ‘_liberté_, _fraternité_ and _égalité_,’
there will be no one brotherly enough to give me a new ink-bottle,”
complained Gabriella. “I don’t suppose I can ever get such a nice,
complete American contrivance as it was. All the time they were fussing
over the matter I was feeling aggrieved at my loss.”

“But it really might have injured some one if it had fallen upon a
French head,” said Sidney.

“It wouldn’t have been my fault,” returned Gabriella, still aggrieved,
“though I suppose I would have had the blame fixed upon me after the
manner of the French, who do not give foot-passengers the right of way,
but, when these are run down by an impudent cabby, make them pay a
fine for getting in the way, even if they are broken to bits.”

“Do you mean in pocket?” asked Sidney.

“That from you, Sidney Shaw! I didn’t expect it. Wait till you get
out into the streets and are in a hurly burly of automobiles, cabs
and omnibuses, and while you are trying to get out of the way a vile
cab-driver deliberately makes for you, then you’ll not make sickly
puns.”

In response to this lecture, Sidney acknowledged that she had been
sinfully flippant. “That is why,” Gabriella went on, “I answered
Taffy’s note. I knew we should feel the need of a protector in this
wicked city. I think it would be well if you and Gem were each to look
out for one, for I am not sure that one will go around.”

“After which crafty remark I think you would better get ready for
dinner,” suggested Miss Cavendish. “Speak for yourself and Sidney; I
can get along by myself.”

“And I made the sacrifice of meeting that Briton again simply on your
account,” returned Gabriella.

“You outrageous falsifier!” exclaimed Miss Cavendish.

Gabriella laughed, but it was noticed that she dressed with unusual
care that evening.




CHAPTER XIII

“HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RUSSIAN”


There was no lack of cheerful and even entertaining chatter at Madame
Morelle’s table. Her house was a popular one, for it offered many
attractions to the sojourner in Paris; the rooms were clean, the
table, if not lavishly spread, was adequate, though the usual French
economies were apparent, and the prices were very moderate. Madame,
herself, was thoroughly French, quick, excitable, ready to take offence
at slight provocation, but kind-hearted and an excellent manager. That
quiet which is a distinguishing mark of gentility did not pervade her
establishment. If Madame shut a door she slammed it; if she gave an
order it was heard up and down stairs; if she chided it was with such
violence that the trembling maids cringed before her and hastened away
at the first chance of escape; yet they adored her and imitated her in
a small way, though Nanette’s voice was silver sweet, and the smiling
little Normandy peasant, Marie, could not have scared a kitten. Madame
was a dressy person of large presence, who sailed around her premises
in elaborate _matinées_ before the _déjeuner_ and appeared in elegant
costumes at dinner, her loud-voiced volubility announcing her arrival
wherever she went.

At table Gabriella found herself placed by the side of a young Russian,
while Sidney’s next neighbor was a Dutchman who wore a large seal
ring upon his forefinger. Miss Cavendish sat between the two girls
and had for her vis-à-vis the elder Miss Bailey, whose chair crowded
that of a little angular American school-marm who spoke French with
such a decided Yankee accent that Gabriella dared not look at her
friends after first hearing her speak. A bluff old Yorkshireman with a
deep rolling voice and hearty manner came next, and beyond these the
company presented the same variety of nationalities ending at the head
of the long table with Madame Morelle herself, who kept up a lively
conversation accompanied by many expressive little shrieks, rollings of
eyes and shrugs of shoulders.

After dinner it was the custom of the boarders to repair to the pretty
little salon which Madame assured her newly arrived guests was at the
disposal of those who wished to occupy it. The young Dutchman followed
Sidney to a quiet corner to continue the conversation favorably begun
at the table. Miss Bailey drew Gabriella to her side, while Miss
Mildred engaged Miss Cavendish’s attention. The entrance of Owen Morgan
put an end to all this, for he insisted upon taking all his friends
out for a ride on top of an omnibus to see the boulevards by night.
He had greeted them all as if they were old friends, though Gabriella
stiffened ever so slightly at his appropriation of herself as a matter
of course. Miss Bailey declared that she did not know that Mildred
ought to go, but that young creature with a petulant air pouted and
bridled until her sister gave in, though insisting that she would
prefer to stay at home. She made it known that she did not like to
climb to the top of an omnibus, and that she did not care to stay below
by herself. It seemed a matter difficult to adjust until the young
Dutchman threw himself into the breach and offered to sit below if
Sidney would bear him company, and thus it was arranged.

“You are a dear,” said Gabriella to Sidney as they went to get their
hats. “You will miss the best of it by not being above, but I will
change with you coming back. How does the Dutchman happen to go with
us?”

“Mr. Morgan invited him, for it seems that Miss Bailey knows something
about him.”

“What is his name, anyhow, and where did he get his ring? Is he a
burgomaster or something? He looks exactly like some of those portraits
in the Museum at Amsterdam. I suppose his name is van Stecklenhorst or
Sniffelberger.”

“It is van Schepel.”

“That’s not quite so bad. I knew it had to be a van something on
account of that monster ring. Can he speak intelligible English?”

“Oh, yes, he can do fairly well, and, like most foreigners, he is eager
to improve his opportunities. I think that is why he has fastened upon
us; we are but agents in the matter of his education.”

“Oh!” Gabriella looked incredulous, but Sidney evidently considered
that she had discovered the facts in the case.

It was a warm night and the boulevards were thronged. Every little
table on the sidewalks appeared to be occupied. At the brilliantly
lighted cafés crowds were gathered; carriages dashed up and down,
automobiles shot ahead of the rumbling ’buses.

“Isn’t it gay?” Gabriella turned to speak to her companion. “Why, where
is Miss Cavendish?” she asked in surprise.

“There were not seats enough above,” Mr. Morgan told her, “and you know
you ran up ahead of us all, so I am deputed to look after you.”

“Dear me, I thought the man said ‘quatre places.’”

“So he did, but some others held tickets.”

“Oh, dear, I didn’t mean to oust Gem out of a place; I supposed she was
directly behind me. Can’t we make room for just one more? There, some
one is getting off?”

“If you prefer,” returned Mr. Morgan a little stiffly, “I will go and
notify Miss Cavendish, though I may lose my place meanwhile, and you
would be left up here unprotected.”

“I don’t know that I should mind that,” answered Gabriella perversely.

“But this is Paris. Would you elect to travel around New York or
Washington by yourself alone at night?”

“Oh, dear, yes,” returned the girl flippantly. “It is my common
custom.” And to her delight Mr. Morgan looked shocked. “You know
American girls always do as they please,” she went on. “Of course we
carry pistols whenever we go out, for if we stay out after midnight
we might be held up by a highwayman; they are so frequently met with,
you know. I remember once when a pair of banditti demanded my money or
my life I had forgotten to load my pistol before I started out, and I
simply scared them off by a bluff.”

“Gabriella, what are you talking about?” came a voice from the other
side of the bench. “Mr. Morgan, she is simply fooling you,” said Miss
Cavendish, who had taken the one place unobserved by the other two.

“Why, Gem, how did you get up here?” exclaimed Gabriella.

“I noticed that some one had made room for me, and so I came up to join
you. What cock-and-bull story was she telling you, Mr. Morgan? Has she
been trying to make you believe that American girls go around at night
at will without proper escort?”

“Something like that,” he admitted.

“But why try to produce that impression, Gabriella?” Miss Cavendish
inquired.

“Oh, because Englishmen are so dense and it is so easy to fool them
into thinking extreme things about us,” returned Gabriella, laughing.

“Am I dense?” asked Mr. Morgan.

“Sometimes,” Gabriella did not hesitate to say. “If an English girl had
told one of our men such a tale as that he would have matched it with
something a little stronger instead of half believing it.”

“Ah, but you see an English girl would never have dreamed of doing such
a thing,” replied Mr. Morgan, as if that settled it.

“I believe you,” returned Gabriella fervently. And here they reached
the café toward which they were bound.

“Isn’t it fun?” Gabriella was nothing if not appreciative. “I am so
glad to see Paris by night. It is what I longed to do. I think I shall
like to spend half my time on top of the omnibuses.”

They seated themselves at tables before a small café, where ices were
served them, and where a strange drink termed “_limonade gazeuse_”
took the place of an American lemonade or an English “lemon squash.”
At their leisure they watched the passing crowds, which seemed only to
increase as the hour grew later. “It is splendid,” said Gabriella as
they made ready to go, “but--”

“But what?” Mr. Morgan asked.

“It isn’t Italy.”

“That is what Gabriella always says,” Sidney remarked. “As if we
expected it would be Italy. She is Italy daft and nothing less than a
villa at Sorrento and an orange grove will ever satisfy her.”

“I am thinking of buying one,” said Gabriella nonchalantly. “Mamma
would like the life, I am sure. I need only give up a few things, you
know; a few utterly unnecessary things like more diamonds and a new
automobile, and my yacht. I should like to try one of those row-boats
where the men stand up and row; they look so picturesque, and I have no
doubt I can get a villa quite cheaply.”

Miss Cavendish bit her lip and shook her head at the girl, who at this
silent admonition only chattered on.

“I think I must get Signor Rondinelli to look out for a bargain for me.”

Mr. Morgan glanced at the young Dutchman, who was listening
interestedly, and then he looked gravely at Gabriella, who answered
with an innocent smile. “No,” she said, addressing him, “I shall never
be quite happy to live anywhere but in Italy. I wonder I have been so
long finding it out.”

“It must be time to go,” said Miss Bailey, who had been only half
listening to this talk. “We shall be locked out and shall have to ring
up the concierge, and he is so cross.”

“His wife is worse,” returned Sidney; “I always rush past her so that
I may avoid her black looks. I think she knows we are the ones who
allowed the ink-bottle to roll out the window.”

“She lacks a sense of humor,” said Gabriella, as she and Mr. Morgan led
the way up the bright boulevard.

“I believe you Americans charge us with a lack of humor,” Mr. Morgan
ventured to say.

“I don’t think I am capable of judging, having never been in England.
You are the first Englishman I have ever known.”

“And my sense of humor is weak?”

“How shall I test it? Let me see, you have rather a pretty wit at
times, as they used to say. Do you enjoy Alice in Wonderland?”

“I certainly do.”

“Then you stand outside the ban. I simply adore Alice.”

“I am delighted that you agree with me on that one point.”

“Don’t I always agree with you?”

“Seldom. Except at San Miniato I can recall but few instances.”

“And I suppose in your lordly Briton way you like girls to agree with
you; to be very sweet and say ‘Quite so,’ or, ‘Fancy,’ or ‘Ow,’ and
allow you to do most of the talking. Have you the English opinion
which insists that Americans talk too much?”

Mr. Morgan considered the question with gravity. “I think some of them
talk more than is necessary,” he answered guardedly. “At times I have
met those who would be more charming if they added a little repose to
their manner.”

“And a little more softness to their quality of voice.”

“Quite so.”

“And no doubt you like a floppy, flowing style of dress.” Gabriella
began to wax indignant.

“No, I like the way American girls dress. I can always tell them from
English girls.”

“How do you distinguish us, pray?”

“By your belts,” said Mr. Morgan, confidentially. “American girls
always wear their belts so they go up in the back and down in front,
and English girls wear theirs in just the opposite way.”

Gabriella laughed gleefully.

“And you have a way of putting on your veils which no other girls can
imitate,” continued Mr. Morgan, “and you wear less jewelry, trinkets
and chains and things, you know.”

“I have noticed that,” returned Gabriella, “though I don’t think that
can be said of all Americans; some women are overloaded even when they
are not in the drawing-room.”

“But surely jewels are very feminine. You wouldn’t have women discard
them, would you?”

“No, but I would have them wear such ornaments only upon appropriate
occasions.”

“Ow!” Mr. Morgan was pondering over this as Gabriella fell back that
she might join Miss Cavendish.

“We are discussing the differences between the English and the
Americans,” Gabriella informed her friend.

“But why discuss?” rejoined Miss Cavendish. “We don’t pretend to be
alike. Why should we be? It is the very distinctive difference which
makes the charm. One doesn’t want England to be America, else one might
as well stay at home. I have no patience with Anglomaniacs. We can
love and admire the English without slavishly aping them. Why should
an American persist in calling stables ‘mews,’ and roofs ‘leads,’
when it is not the custom to do so in her own country? It is deadly
affected, and those who try to out-English the English seem to me to
be either ashamed of their own country or to desire to make themselves
laughing-stocks.”

“I quite agree with you,” returned Mr. Morgan. “Americans are
unaffectedly breezy and are charming enough for anyone. Why they should
ever wish to be neither one thing nor the other I fail to see. When
one lives in a country it is sometimes advisable to adopt certain
expressions, but these need not be extreme ones, and such adoptions
are usually of slow growth.”

“Then I may keep my American vocabulary, may I?” said Gabriella
laughing.

“Pray do, if you want to preserve your individuality,” Mr. Morgan
returned.

“Oh, I’ve not the faintest ambition to be English,” returned the girl
with a little toss of her head.

“What did make you so contrary to-night?” Miss Cavendish asked her when
they had reached their room.

“Was I contrary? I don’t know that I was.”

“You certainly tried to give Mr. Morgan a wrong impression of yourself.”

“He is such an excellent subject for my imagination to work upon, and
you know I told you I meant to pretend that I was the heiress.”

“Do you want him to think that?”

“Certainly. Why not?”

“I didn’t know,” returned Miss Cavendish feebly. “He seems such an
honest, single-hearted young man; it seems rather a shame to jolly him.”

“It wasn’t all on his account. There was the Dutchman, you know. I am
seized with a wild yearning for that monster ring. I would wrap a cord
around it and wear it on my thumb, if I had it. I think I must ask
Sidney to change places with me at table so I can feast my eyes on that
marvel. Wouldn’t it be lovely to get him to teach me Dutch and have
him point out the words with his forefinger?”

“Gabriella, you are the silliest child I know. I don’t wonder the
girls at school used to call you Gaby. Would you entice that poor
unsuspecting young Dutchman into your toils?”

“For the sake of the ring I shall have to do it, if I can. I did have
designs upon that barbarous, wide-mouthed Russian who sits next me, but
unhappily I asked him if he drank Japanese tea and he hasn’t spoken to
me since. I may try to reinstate myself in his good graces; it would
be rather fun to have a barbarous Russian in love with you, rather
exciting and full of action such an experience would be, I fancy. If
you are so impressed with the virtues of Owen Glendower, you may take
him off my hands at the Salon to-morrow, and I’ll talk to the Dutchman,
for he is going, too.”

“I though you had selected the simple Taffy as a soubriquet for your
Welsh friend.”

“So I had, until I was suddenly reminded that I was filching from Du
Maurier’s ‘Trilby,’ and as our friend already had the Owen it was easy
to add the Glendower.”

The expedition to the Salon was successfully undertaken so far as all
were concerned except Owen Morgan, for spying her neighbor at table,
catalogue in hand, Gabriella had no difficulty in attaching him to her
side, leaving Mr. Morgan to Miss Cavendish’s good graces, while Mr.
van Schepel followed in Sidney’s train. “It was my mission to explain
the pictures to that young man,” Gabriella told Miss Cavendish when
taken to task for her disaffection. “He doesn’t know very much about
art and I thought it was the part of a Christian to try to broaden his
knowledge of things artistic. You didn’t mind, did you, Gem?”

“No, but Mr. Morgan did. He made the engagement with you and it was not
courteous to desert him.”

“But he invited us all, and he had you, what more did he want?”

“He evidently wanted more, or less, since you are not so big as I.”

“Well, never mind; I’ll make it all right with him. Let’s talk about
the Russian; he is quite a new type. He is the son of a count who has
estates in the Ural mountains. Isn’t that interesting? I wonder how
it would seem to live there. Do you suppose he has a castle and would
give his daughter-in-law all the sables she could wear? I thought his
name must be queer and it is: Rowtowsky. What became of Sidney and the
Dutchman?”

“Gabriella, you fly from one subject to another like a--”

“Humming-bird, yes, I have been told that. I want to tell Sidney that
I’d rather not change places with her. The Russian is to the fore, now.
He is going to give us tea to-night, and show us how they drink it in
Russia. I made him entirely forget what I said about Japanese tea. He
is so very homesick, poor fellow, and says he misses his home customs.
They always drink tea about ten o’clock at night and have a cosy time
over it. I believe he said they put preserves in it.”

“Nonsense, Gabriella.”

“I am sure he did. You will see to-night.”

Her prediction proved true, for the Russian, who had brought out his
own packet of choice tea, brewed it after his own fashion and invited
all the ladies to partake. He set forth quite a little feast for them,
cakes, fruit, and preserved strawberries, which latter he begged
they would try in their tea. At home, he told them, the men drank
from glasses, the ladies from cups, and a spoonful of the sweets was
considered an addition to a cup of tea.

Gabriella was the first to try it, and was enthusiastic in her praises,
to the delight of the Russian, who became quite gay over his little
tea-party and who made a genial and courteous host. The Dutchman never
left Sidney’s side, to Gabriella’s delight.

She sought Sidney’s room at a later hour. “Wasn’t it fun?” she cried,
as she established herself on the foot of the bed. “Shall you like
living in Holland, Sidney? How dear you will look in a little white cap
with a pair of brass bed-springs over your ears, or will you prefer
the gold plate with a cap a-top and a bonnet perched upon that? And
however will you manage to keep your house as clean as you will be
expected to do?”

“I shall like it quite as well as you will like Russia,” retorted
Sidney, “and I shall be able to keep my house clean quite as easily as
you will know how to control a half savage household.”

Gabriella enjoyed the reply to the fullest. “It will be so exciting to
have bouts with the moujiks, is that what they call them? They shall
have so many lashes apiece if they don’t behave themselves. I shall
have to learn to take preserves _to_ my tea, as Miss Bailey says,
but it will be very hard to learn the language; they say it is so
difficult; that is one of the things that depresses me.”

“And what are some of the others?”

“I am afraid of having a bomb thrown under my carriage. It would be so
unpleasant to be gathered up in a basket and be buried in sections.”

“Don’t mention such ghastly possibilities,” said Sidney in horror. “Go
to bed before you give me occasion for nightmare. I’m tired to death.”

“So am I, but it is a pleasant sort of tired, and though I long to
lie awake and think over the delightful things that happen every day
I never have a chance, for I drop off to sleep right away. One thing
before we part, Sid. Did you see Miss Bailey waylay me in the hall, the
simple-minded dear?”

“Yes, what did she want?”

“She told me that I mustn’t mind Mr. Morgan’s not coming to-night, for
she remembered that he had told her of a business call he had to make;
as if I were interested.”

“What did you say?”

“I told her it was a matter of no interest to me, and she said ‘Ow,
my deah,’ in that lovely English way of hers and looked shocked. I
think she imagined in her simple old British heart that I was telling
tarradiddles.”

“And were you?” asked Sidney, sharply.

“Good-night,” returned Gabriella.




CHAPTER XIV

WHITHER? TOGETHER


Much was crowded into the next few weeks, for, with all Paris to see
and the important matter of gowns and hats to attend to, there was
little idle time. Since Gabriella’s extravagance consisted in the
ordering of but one gown at a modest price, and a simple hat, she had
rather more leisure than the other two, who had frequent visits to pay
to dressmakers, and who started off together in the early morning,
leaving Gabriella to follow at her convenience. That Gabriella made
the most of these unfettered moments may well be imagined; if she did
not spend them at the Louvre with the Russian, she took advantage of
the time to explore out-of-the-way places with the Briton. Upon the
Dutchman her blandishments had little effect, for he was a follower
in Sidney’s train and to her quiet little self gave his undivided
attention whenever she would permit, though one day at the end of three
weeks he took a sudden departure.

There were days, too, when the whole party, the Baileys included, would
take a trip to Versailles or to Fontainebleau. One afternoon gave them
an outing up the river to St. Cloud, and an early morning expedition
was made to the market. And thus the time passed rapidly and happily
till at the end of a month they were still lingering in Paris, but
making feeble efforts to leave. By this time the Baileys had taken
their departure, though Mr. Morgan still tarried.

“It is the dressmakers and the shopping and all that which has taken
so much time,” said Miss Cavendish one morning as she set upon her
handsome head a hat which had just been sent home.

“Yes, but it has been worth while,” returned Gabriella, regarding her
admiringly. “You are a dream in that hat, Gem. I don’t see how you are
to escape returning a countess or at least a marquise, if you appear in
it.”

“As if I were so silly as to be dazzled by a title,” said Miss
Cavendish, taking off the hat and turning it around on her hand. “No,
my dear, I shall remain Isabella Cavendish to the end of the chapter.”

“I don’t believe it,” retorted Gabriella. “We have none of us escaped
the adoration of foreign masculines, so why should you, who are the
best looking? Anything more distinguished than you in that hat it would
be hard to find. As for Sidney, she is a new creature. Her friends
won’t know her in her costumes which we shall take the credit of having
selected.”

“If I am not to be recognized I shall be sorry that I have them,”
remarked Sidney, who had just come into the room with an open letter in
her hand and an expression of half amusement, half annoyance upon her
face. “It seems mean to show you this, but it is too funny to keep.”

“What is it?” asked Gabriella, holding out her hand.

“On second thoughts I’ll not show you; I’ll simply tell you the
contents of this letter. It is from Mr. van Schepel and it is a
proposal of marriage.”

Gabriella clapped her hands. “What did I tell you? I knew his
philanderings meant something. Oh, Sid, now you will have a chance to
wear the monster ring.”

“Nonsense, Gabriella,” returned Sidney. “Of course I couldn’t accept
him. He has written in such funny English that at first I couldn’t tell
just what he meant, but at the end, when he said that he would have
offered himself before he left Paris, but he had to ask the consent of
his parents first, then I understood.”

“Good little boy! Did he really say that, Sid?”

“He certainly did. Listen.” She read a few sentences from her letter.

“I can scarce believe it in this age and generation. Isn’t it
delicious? Go on, what else?”

“He says that he will return to Paris at once if I will accept him, and
that he left hastily that he might return before we left.”

“Dear me.”

“Oh, but I threw cold water upon that plan. I wrote him that it would
not be the slightest use for him to return, for I had left my heart in
America.”

“And have you?” asked Gabriella quickly.

The soft color overspread Sidney’s face as she said: “It seemed the
best excuse, and one that would not allow of any protest.”

“But that doesn’t answer my question.”

“Which you haven’t any right to ask,” put in Miss Cavendish. “That was
a wise reply, Sidney.”

“I am sure I never gave him any undue encouragement, do you think I
did, Gem? He always would come, you know, and I was merely polite.”

“He had the good taste to observe your own individual charm, dear, and
perhaps your sweet courtesy was misunderstood.”

“That comes of being too amiable,” returned Sidney. “I am sure I didn’t
intend to make him think I favored him, but he evidently thinks I did.
I am sorry.”

“I shouldn’t let it bother me in the very least,” Gabriella was ready
with advice. “I find that a very little affability goes a great way
with these foreigners. I am constantly having to turn and rend the
Russian or I am confident that I should be carried off willy-nilly. I
don’t know yet that I shall escape. It is a great temptation, however,
to see just how far you can go without damage.”

“I shouldn’t go too far, you might arouse the bear’s ugly side. I’ll be
ready in a minute, Gem. I hope Madame Picot will not keep us an hour as
she did the last time.” And Sidney left the room.

“I think I shall go to the Louvre,” remarked Gabriella, drumming
thoughtfully on the table. “You are not likely to be back before
_déjeuner_, I suppose. Perhaps I shall go to the Bon Marché to see if
they have any more of those feathers that I have been yearning for ever
since I saw them. Gem, do you suppose Sidney really has left her heart
in America, and that is why she has that far-away look sometimes and
seems so indifferent.”

“I think it is not unlikely. Sidney is not the expansive young person
that you are, and does not discuss such matters with the freedom of
Gabriella Thorne.”

“Do you think I tell everything?”

“I should not be far from wrong if I said I did.”

“Well, I don’t,” returned Gabriella, diving into a drawer for her
gloves. “Good-by, Lovely. I shall probably be back to _déjeuner_, but
if I am not don’t worry. I shall avoid international questions to-day,
and shall give Monsieur Le Russe to understand that I cannot allow my
fortune to be devoted to the development of Russian mines.” She went
out, leaving the effect of her breezy presence behind her.

“Bless the child,” said Miss Cavendish to herself, “she is a joy even
at her naughtiest.”

Into the clean street Gabriella stepped, passing the surly _concierge_
with a smile and a _bon jour_. In the doorway of the small _laiterie_
across the way stood the woman from whom Gabriella frequently bought
a supply of cream for the afternoon tea which the three prepared in
their own rooms. The girl gave a cheery nod to the little shopkeeper.
At the corner was the boy from whom she bought her daily _Herald_, and
he smiled at her recognition of him. As she made a dash across the
Champs Élysées for the entrance to the “Met,” she ran into the arms of
some one crossing from the opposite side. “Oh, pardon, monsieur,” she
exclaimed. She was answered by a laugh, and looking up, she saw Mr.
Morgan. “Oh, is it you?” she said. “I feel less embarrassed since you
prove not to be a Frenchman. I was in such a hurry to get out of the
way of that dreadful red automobile that was bearing down upon me. I
had only just escaped from a string of clattering cabs and thought I
was safe. Isn’t the Champs Élysées dreadful?”

“It isn’t so bad now as in the spring and fall.”

“It is bad enough. Oh, never mind. I can get the rest of the way
without endangering my life.”

“It is my way, too.”

“But you were going in the opposite direction.”

“Until I saw you.”

“Then where are you going, now?”

“Wherever you are, if you will allow.”

“I thought of going to the Louvre.”

“To meet Mr. Rowtowsky?”

“No, for I have just been telling Gem that I had decided not to invest
my fortune in Russia. It would be disloyal to America, you know.”

Mr. Morgan smiled and looked down at her. “I think myself it would be
rather unsafe at this time of dissension and disruption.”

“Thanks for your opinion. It is always so assuring to have a man’s
views of such questions. I don’t know what would become of me if I
had to exist without a million at my command. It would be dreadful
if I were to lose my large inheritance by allowing my sentiment to
overbalance my discretion.”

An amused look came into Mr. Morgan’s eyes. “It must be a delightful
experience to possess unlimited means,” he said. “You American girls
are so frank. It is refreshing to hear you speak so candidly of your
fortune. Most of us would be a little shy about it.”

“But I never am shy. I was not as a child; Gem can tell you that. Here
comes our train, if you insist upon the Louvre this morning.”

“I don’t insist; I even would suggest the Luxembourg.”

“Then let us go there. I am glad of the chance, for I don’t
know my way so well about that quarter, and you can take all the
responsibility.”

“I shall be delighted.”

They retraced their steps, turned aside and found the proper tram for
the Luxembourg quarter and were presently at the gallery. “You have
not told me yet how you are pleased with the modern French school,”
said Mr. Morgan. “Now that you have seen the Salon as well as the older
exhibitions, what is your verdict?”

“I think the modern school has made a wonderful advance in landscape
painting. It is as if they had only lately discovered atmosphere and
color for out-door pictures, but when it comes to an expression on
canvas of a spiritual truth, in genre painting, I cannot see that they
have gained. I was disappointed in the Salon, I must confess.”

“Why?”

“Oh, because there was such an evidence of a materialistic spirit.
After coming from a study of those old Italian paintings I missed the
real fervor, the real divine spark. These modern men know how to put
on paint, I admit, but they have no soul, and after all when it comes
to technique, who can equal Franz Hals? And as to color, where can
Titian be excelled, or Palma Vecchio, or Rubens? And as to the intense
spirituality of the old masters it can never be approached in this age.
Even old Cimabue and Giotto have a far greater charm for me than these
modern flesh painters, who are not artists after all.”

“Do you include all in that assertion? What of your own Sargent?”

“Oh, I don’t mean to say that I think there are no artists nowadays,
but that there are very few, and I do maintain that there was more real
artistic feeling, more of the divine spark, in that long ago, before
faith grew cold and Mammon was god of all.”

“Yet you couldn’t exist without a million at your command, you said a
while ago.”

“Did I? Oh, well, I am not an artist. Genius always burns more brightly
in a garret than in a palace, and thrives better on a crust than on a
_pâté-de-foies-gras_, though, for my own part, I prefer the latter. I
might make a compromise, however, and be perfectly willing to subsist
for the rest of my life upon _spaghetti pomo d’ora_.”

“It isn’t half bad, I admit, and I know of a little place off the
Boulevard des Italiennes where they cook it to perfection. Suppose we
go there and have a dish of it for our luncheon. Can’t we do that?”

“I confess it tempts me. Would it-- Do you think-- Could Gem object?”

“If you think so, of course we will not go.”

Gabriella thought he looked a little hurt and answered quickly: “On
second thoughts I don’t see how anyone could possibly object, and I
think it would be great fun. I shouldn’t hesitate at home, so why
here?”

“Why indeed? Then when you have had your fill of the Luxembourg
pictures let us go into the garden and watch the people.”

“I am ready now, for I like the gardens,” returned Gabriella, “they are
the very expression of _liberté_, _fraternité_ and _égalité_. It does
me good to see families congregating there, mothers with their sewing
and mending, chatting to their neighbors, and the little children
playing around. The little things come to no harm, for when they are
not directly under the eyes of the mothers they have the guardianship
of the gendarmes. These people know how to get fresh air and be
sociable at the same time.”

“The Latins are very different from the Anglo-Saxons in the matter
of sociability. We put hedges around our gardens and lock our gates
to keep out the rabble, while here the green parks are free to all,
and the Frenchman prefers to take his breakfast in the eyes of the
world instead of behind closed doors. How do you manage such things in
America?”

“Oh, we close the doors. Our parks and squares are generally open,
however, though they are generally given over to the nursemaids and
their charges, with a sprinkling of tramps. An American woman would no
more think of doing her week’s mending in the public square than she
would think of flying. See that dear creature over there putting a
patch upon her husband’s blue blouse; she looks as placid and content
as possible; and that little body next her with the knitting has
evidently an interesting tale to tell. This is a much better way to get
the neighborhood news than to leave the breakfast dishes in order to
hang over the back fence or to shut oneself up in a stuffy little room
while the children squabble in the gutter.”

“You are not the aggressive upholder of American institutions that one
sometimes meets.”

“I hope not. I am aggressive when persons attack those things of which
they know nothing, but I see our faults and I can admire good wherever
I see it.”

“I wonder what you will think of England and Wales.”

“I expect to love them. I have gone wild over every country even when
I had the disadvantage of not knowing the languages, so what will I do
when I get to England? I hope we can go to Wales, but Gem is not sure
that we can. Sidney is only lent to us for six months, though Miss
Cavendish means to stretch the time and call it six months from the
time we landed till we sail for home. We are due in London the first
of August, a stupid time to be there, they tell me, but we cannot be
in each place in May and June, which we are always told are the proper
months, and what is one to do?”

“It does seem rather an intricate question, but I am sure you will
find enough to interest you in London at any season of the year.”

The bells rang out the noonday hour and they started forth through the
historic old streets where long-haired students passed them and smiling
little maidens, in gay fripperies, tripped along, where fruit vendors
cried their wares and flower girls offered bouquets, until they had
crossed the river, the square towers of Notre Dame looming up to their
right and the Arc de Triomphe, a reminder of past glories, on their
left. “It is a beautiful city.” Gabriella gave utterance to the fact as
if it had newly come to her knowledge. “It seems to me that it grows
more beautiful each time I view it from a new point, yet I should never
care to make my home here. A season, a year, yes, I’d like that, but
after all, when one wants steady satisfaction it must be furnished by a
place which is something more than merely gay and amusing.”

“Yet Paris has its sober side, its intellectual enjoyment to offer.
Down there at the Sorbonne you can fancy there is some serious
thinking.”

“Yes, but one scarcely ever confronts that side unless he makes a
business of seeking it. Even the poor here appear to take their poverty
in a less self-absorbed way than with us. They don’t look so utterly
and hopelessly miserable, but as if they could take their thoughts off
themselves and be amused if anything came along.”

“Yet there is wretchedness enough.”

“Oh, I don’t doubt that, but it isn’t so palpable as in some cities. Is
this the place? Isn’t it queer?”

It was the haunt of foreigners, of artists, authors and journalists, so
there was a Bohemian smack to the occasion which pleased Gabriella’s
love of the unconventional. The presence of two or three respectable
American ladies, however, gave her a sense of safety, and she felt no
compunctions. Over their dish of sphaghetti, with a straw-covered flask
of Chianti, the two lingered, imagining themselves back in Italy, and
the talk grew reminiscent and personal, so that they tarried long and
only left the place with reluctance.

“It is such charming weather,” said Mr. Morgan, as they issued from
the dim little restaurant, “that it seems a shame to waste any time
in-doors. What do you say to making a day of it and of going to the
Bois? I’d be willing to listen even to Browning if I could hear you
read it out-of-doors. We can stop in at Brentano’s and get a copy of
anything you may prefer, as a reminder of Florence, and we will add a
bit of poetry to our reminiscence of this day. Will you agree?”

Gabriella consented. She would live for the hour, she told herself. It
would soon be over, so why not enjoy it while she could? She would not
stop to consider what might be the outcome. Sufficient unto the day was
the pleasure thereof, and with this decision made, she was ready to be
her gayest, her happiest, her most charming.

Under the shadow of a great tree the hours of the afternoon passed
quickly for both. If there were not much poetry read, there was much
felt, and when Mr. Morgan scribbled Gabriella’s name and the date on
the fly-leaf of the book he had bought, and asked her to keep it as
a remembrance of the day, she accepted without demur, and gave him,
at his asking for a keepsake, a quaint silver bauble, the tiniest of
silver frames, into which she had stuck a miniature photograph of a Fra
Angelica angel. She had carried the wee frame, in her pocketbook ever
since the day when the two had been together at San Miniato; she had
bought the little souvenir that same afternoon on the Ponto Vecchio.

It was six o’clock before the truant entered the room where Miss
Cavendish was preparing for dinner. “Well, you little runaway,”
exclaimed she, “you did make a day of it. Give an account of yourself.
Where have you been?”

“Where I shall never go again,” replied Gabriella unsteadily. “It has
been a heavenly day, Gem dear, but it is over. It has passed into
the has beens; it will never come back again. The glory of Paris has
departed, and I don’t care how soon we leave it.”

Miss Cavendish put down the brush she was holding. She saw the
tear-drops shining on Gabriella’s long lashes. She looked at the
quivering lips which tried to smile and she opened her arms and
gathered the girl close to her. “Dear baby,” she whispered, “what has
gone wrong?”

For a moment Gabriella rested her head on her friend’s shoulder, then
she choked back a rising sob and answered: “Everything has gone wrong,
and it is not any better because it is all my own fault. I have been
the entire day with Mr. Morgan.”

“Why, Gabriella Thorne!”

“Yes, I may as well ’fess. Let me keep my face so against your
shoulder, Gem, and don’t look at me while I am telling you. I am safe
here, but if it were not for you I could not do without my mother. I
met Mr. Morgan just as I was going out this morning. We went to the
Luxembourg and then to a funny little foreign place to luncheon; it was
all so dear and queer and unusual. We talked a great deal, of course,
and became very confidential, so that we seemed to know each other
better than ever before. I felt myself going, but I just let myself go,
and jumped, yes, actually jumped at the idea of spending the afternoon
with him at the Bois reading. We didn’t read much, but I shall never
forget what we did read. I have the comfort of possessing the little
book at least; there it is on the bed; he gave it to me. Before we came
away he--he-- Oh Gem, I was a fool to pretend that I was an heiress,
for somehow I couldn’t seem to find a chance to tell him differently
or else I was contrary, I don’t know which, and of course he thought I
was rich; he wouldn’t have asked me else, I am afraid; and of course
I had to refuse him because I knew he thought I had money, and he is
going to leave the city to-night and I shall never see him again,
never.”

Miss Cavendish held her closer. “And do you care, sweetheart?”

Gabriella lifted her wet eyes and looked past the taller woman. “Care,
of course I care, but I didn’t know how much till I saw him turn the
corner and knew I couldn’t call him back. Now I am caring more and more
every minute the further he gets from me, and I can never let him know,
for he considers what I said as final, and so it is; it has to be, you
see.”

“I don’t exactly see, for if he really loves you he will not care
whether you are rich or not.”

“But he wouldn’t have loved me unless he had thought me rich, and when
he finds out that I have deceived him, that I have been playing the
adventuress, don’t you see he must despise me?”

“Not if he understands that it was all a joke.”

“But it wasn’t so much of a joke that I couldn’t have told him when we
were getting so confidential.”

“Then why didn’t you tell him?”

“Because, as I told you, I was a contrary fool, and because I was
determined to think he was thinking of the money side of it, and that
made me mad.”

“I cannot yet see that the matter is hopeless.”

“It is very nice of you to try to comfort me, but it is quite hopeless,
for either he was attracted by my supposed wealth, in which case he is
quite impossible, or else he would be disillusioned if he knew what a
fraud I had been, in which case I am quite impossible, so there is an
end of it.”

“It seems dreadful that our journey of joy must be turned to one of
sorrow for you, dearie. I cannot but feel that you will see him again,
for there are the Baileys, you know.”

“Do you suppose I could ever mention the subject to them? I’d die
first. Never mind, Gem, I shall get along. Don’t feel too sorry for me,
perhaps it won’t hurt as much as I think it will. No, I don’t want any
dinner, please.”




CHAPTER XV

A MEDIÆVAL TOWN


Once out of Paris Gabriella’s spirits revived and her love of the novel
and artistic asserted itself. Youth loves change, and indeed, for
most sorrows there is perhaps no better cure than new scenes and new
interests. Therefore when Rouen’s towers and belfries arose before the
travellers it was Gabriella who appeared most enthusiastic.

They had something of an adventure at the very outset and Gabriella’s
sense of humor was too great for her not to appreciate the situation
and to be the merriest of the party which endured a long wait at
the railway station. They had driven off gaily enough from Madame
Morelle’s, themselves in one open carriage and their baggage piled high
in another, arriving in ample time to secure their places. “Is this the
train for Rouen?” asked Miss Cavendish, who had been told that there
were no second-class carriages on certain of the trains.

“Oui, madame,” was the prompt reply of the guard, who hurried them into
their places, and to their surprise they were on their way in less than
five minutes.

“My watch cannot be so far wrong, and besides I looked at the clock
in the station and we had a full half-hour,” said Miss Cavendish. “I
imagined that it was a greater distance from the house, or I could have
started later. We must have caught an earlier train.”

“So much the better,” was Gabriella’s prompt reply. “We shall get to
Rouen that much the sooner.”

“But I told them our trunks were for the four-thirty train.”

“Never mind, we can either wait for them or can make a little turn
about the town until the next train comes in.”

However they arrived in a drizzling rain and concluded not to attempt
any tour of investigation. “It was an earlier train, you see,” said
Miss Cavendish.

“Well, we can wait here just as well as in Paris,” said Sidney, and
they stationed themselves upon a bench outside the waiting-room.

An official approached. Could he assist them? No, they told him, they
were but waiting for the arrival of the next train. They thought he
looked a little surprised, but they were not discomfited. They walked
up and down; they watched the primitive method of switching off cars
from one track to another by means of a rope and a small turn-table;
they watched the clock. They began to feel the pangs of hunger, but
they perceived no way of satisfying their appetites. There were no
preparations visible for the arrival of their train. The woman who
sold newspapers and postal cards shut up shop and went home. The men
disappeared one by one. The place took on a deserted look.

“They can’t have told us wrong,” Miss Cavendish exclaimed at last.
“Sidney, you speak the most fluent French; go ask again if our luggage
came on the train with us.”

Sidney and Gabriella walked off to the baggage room, soon returning
with the report that the familiar little hand trunks were not there.

“I know perfectly well that there was a train to leave at half-past
four,” Miss Cavendish began again to explain, “and I as well know that
we came on an earlier one, so now what has become of that later one?
That is what I should like to know.” She approached the guard, who was
now the sole representative of office to be seen. “When does the next
train arrive from Paris?” she asked.

“A dix heures, madame,” he replied.

“Ten o’clock!” exclaimed Miss Cavendish, astonished. “But I was told in
Paris that the train following the one on which we came would be here
at seven-thirty.”

“Yes, madame, at the other station.”

“The other station!” Miss Cavendish stared aghast. She turned to the
girls. Gabriella did not attempt to restrain her laughter, but Sidney
gave heed to their astonished leader, who said: “There seems to be
another station at which trains from Paris arrive, and our luggage is
there, of course. Try to straighten this out, Sidney.”

Sidney came to her rescue, and after an animated conversation
accompanied by many gesticulations on the part of the guard and
expressions of regret that the ladies should have endured so long a
wait for nothing, they learned that a certain tram would take them to
the other station.

It was still raining drearily. It was after eight o’clock. They were
hungry; they were weary. After leaving the car there was a long bridge
to cross. “Why didn’t we take a cab?” groaned Sidney.

“Because the man told us to take a car,” snapped Gabriella; then she
began to laugh. “It is so funny,” she cried, “to think we should have
spent hours in that stuffy old station when we might this minute have
been comfortably lodged and fed.”

“Whoever could have imagined that the trains would be so erratic,”
complained Miss Cavendish. “No one could possibly surmise that an
orderly train would take it upon itself to be so unaccommodating.”

“Perhaps we should then have taken an accommodation train,” suggested
Gabriella.

“Oh, do hush,” exclaimed Miss Cavendish, more out of sorts than they
had ever seen her. “If one leaves a certain station in Paris and
arrives at a certain station in Rouen, what more reasonable to suppose
than that the next train would do the same? Who could dream that they
could go flying off in this absurd way?”

“Nobody could dream of any such thing, Gem dear,” said Gabriella
soothingly.

“And I needn’t be cross about it, need I?” returned Miss Cavendish,
rather ashamed of her ill humour.

They found their trunks without difficulty and snugly established in
a cab they were driven to their lodgings where, late as it was, they
found a supper awaiting them, and were pleased to discover that they
had secured a pleasant abiding place in the home of an Englishwoman who
lived at the edge of the town.

“Two pictures stand out before me when I think of Rouen,” said Miss
Cavendish when they started out on their pilgrimage the next day. “One
is that fearful siege when for months Henry Fifth’s troops lay before
the city, and the other is the trial of poor little Jeanne d’Arc.”

“Poor dear,” sighed Sidney, “I expect to be wrought upon to the last
degree here in Rouen.”

“I am sorry the old town walls are not standing.”

Gabriella looked down the broad street. “I should like to look over
them and imagine the English soldiers encamped before them.”

“I am rather glad they have been done away with,” confessed Miss
Cavendish, “for when one thinks of that haggard, starving, hopeless
company of refugees gathered in the moat outside the city wall, the
little children perishing for bread, the gaunt, bony, skeleton-like men
and women, the fifteen thousand from other cities who had taken refuge
within the walls of Rouen and for whom there was no food within the
walls, when one thinks of those it is well not to have the picture made
more vivid. Think of them, girls, feeding upon such a pitiful supply
of roots and grass as could be dug from that barren moat. Think of the
babies born but to be drawn up in a basket for baptism and lowered
again but to die. No wonder that hundreds perished each night and
that others went mad. No wonder that Canon de Livet stood high on the
ramparts and cursed the English.”

“Oh, don’t, don’t, Gem,” cried Gabriella, her eyes filling, “you are
making the picture too ghastly, too horrible.”

“It is Rouen’s history.”

“I know that it is, but let us take the romantic, happy side of the
town’s story.”

“No, go on,” Sidney gravely encouraged a continuation of the tale. “We
ought to know the misery of life as well as the joy. How did the siege
end, Gem? I forget the details.”

“On Christmas day the English sent out food to the starving band. Some
say it was refused, but I think we may rely upon others who tell us
that it was only too horribly accepted with cries like those of wild
animals. But the little food only prolonged the agony, for the English
lines were not again opened in mercy and the siege went on. Toward the
middle of January, the people having starved long enough, the terms of
capitulation were made. The lives of nine persons only were demanded;
the rest could go free. Only one, however, suffered death.”

“And who was he?”

“Alain Blanchard was beheaded. He was captain of the Arbalétriers, and
was the moving spirit of the town’s resistance. There is a street now
named for him; we will hunt it up, for though for many years he was
regarded as a half mythical hero, later investigations proved that he
was actually a loyal, brave man who died for his country after having
made every sacrifice to rescue it from English rule.”

“How long after that did Jeanne d’Arc come upon the scene?” Sidney
asked, as she wandered down the wide boulevard which followed the line
of the former city wall.

“The end of 1419 saw the end of Normandy’s resistance to the English.
Jeanne d’Arc was then a little country girl running after the pigs and
chickens in the farmyard at Domremy. She was not quite thirteen when
the ‘voices’ came to her, poor little lass, so young, so helpless, so
scared. ‘I am a poor girl, I cannot even ride,’ was her first answer to
the voices, you remember.”

“But she didn’t give up.”

“She gained strength of purpose as time went on, and at last she did
appear before the king, but you know the rest of the story.”

“Such a pitiful one, and here in Rouen the dear, sweet maid was burned
to death.” Gabriella spoke with pathetic regret as if La Pucelle had
been a personal friend.

“Yes, that happened in the Vieux Marché. We will find the place. There
is the tower where she was taken to be tried before her judges. At
first she was kept in an iron cage, there in one of the castle towers,
with four soldiers to guard her as she lay chained to a log of wood.
The donjon, however, is the scene of her splendid courage in answering
her judges as she did. The tower, aside from this interest, is a fine
example of a mediæval donjon tower. It was the dungeon of the castle of
Bouvreuil.”

“Dear Gem, how she does cram for our benefit,” remarked Gabriella. “I
watch her poring over her books with a sense of helpless idleness.”

“She loves to do it,” Sidney assured her, “and after, Rella, she gets
the best of it, for I don’t doubt but she reads up a great deal more
than she tells us.”

They crossed the street and entered the old tower. The moat had given
place to a fresh green sward, but the thick walls, the little slits of
windows from which the young prisoner must have looked wistfully forth,
the massive masonry of the entire building all evidenced the age of the
structure and gave the visitors a sense of its strength. They crept up
the spiral stairway to the upper rooms, deserted and silent reminders
of bygone tragedies.

“I feel as if it had all been but yesterday,” said Sidney, as they
issued into the open air and beheld the beds of flowers sweetly
blooming under the free sky at the very threshold of the grim old
dungeon. “It gives me a catch at the heart, and I feel as if I could
almost hear that poor little peasant girl’s last words as she was borne
along in that rough cart through the uneven streets,” Sidney went on.

“It is too much for me,” said Gabriella. “If I follow up the Maid of
Orleans’ last hours I shall not be fit for anything. Let us pass over
the moment when they scattered her ashes upon the Seine and take up
some other subject.”

“But we must go to Bonsecours and see the memorial.”

“Oh, yes, but that was an afterthought, a late and very insufficient
expiation. How could they think her guilty?”

“Because they accused her of witchcraft. We did not do much better two
hundred years later. It was the English who were responsible.”

“That is what I insisted to--” Gabriella bit her lip and turned to look
up at the beautiful towers of St. Ouen.

“The most beautiful Gothic church, the purest example, it is said, to
be found on the continent.” Miss Cavendish gave the information as they
approached the stately edifice. “As you know, there is little left of
old Rouen, and even mediæval Rouen is fast disappearing in the progress
which insists upon new boulevards and modern architecture.”

“It is a pity, don’t you think?” said Sidney.

“It is from an artistic point of view, yet for health’s sake streets
must be widened, foul old buildings must be done away with. The people
need fresh air and cleanliness if they would advance and cope with the
rest of the world. There is, however, discretion used in making changes
and we shall see some truly mediæval streets and houses. The church was
named for St. Ouen who was buried here in 689, but the present building
is the fifth on the site. The earliest was at that time without the
city walls. The former abbey of St. Ouen was supposed to have been
founded in 523, but there is also a tradition that a church was founded
nearly two centuries before, and that its name was changed to the
present one when St. Ouen’s body was brought to it for burial.”

“It certainly is a noble church,” remarked Gabriella, as they stepped
inside. “It satisfies me, Gem, in almost every detail. That cauliflower
window is bad, but the others are a delight. It is more delightful than
the cathedral. I shall want to come in here many times before we leave
Rouen.”

“The centuries have left too many impressions of the various hands
which have wrought out the cathedral for it to be altogether
satisfactory,” remarked Miss Cavendish, “though, like the curate’s egg,
‘it is excellent in parts.’”

“I like the dear little old crypt of St. Gervais,” Sidney said. “It
is so early and so Christian. It dates from before the time of the
cathedral and is as interesting as anything we have seen. Dear me, we
shall get deeper and deeper into legend and history the longer we tarry
here. The stories are fascinating; that one of Fredegond and Brunhilda,
and the fable of St. Romain who delivered Rouen from a dreadful
monster, and which gave rise to the Privilege du St. Romain.”

“I like the tale of Rou or Rolf or Rollo, or whatever his name was,”
rejoined Gabriella. “It pleases me to think of a yellow-haired viking
coming out of the north, blowing upon his ivory horn and waving his
blood red banner. Rolf the Ganger, the sea king, who took possession
of this submissive land, but who was willing to become vassal to the
king’s daughter. I like the way the record reads: ‘he received from
the Karoling King all the lands from the river Epte and westwards to
Brittany with the hand of the Princess Gisela.’ It is delightful to
think he could hang his golden bracelets on a tree in his hunting
forest where they remained till he came that way again.”

“That was because of the strictness of his laws more than because of
the honesty of his followers, I am inclined to think,” Miss Cavendish
observed. “Those old pirate dukes and their followers could scarcely
have been distinguished by a modesty which forbade them to take what
they found.”

“I like the story of Richard the Fearless, too,” Sidney went on, “and
of the Sacristan of St. Ouen. Oh, yes, Rouen can supply us with legends
and fables for months to come.”

“But just now,” Miss Cavendish reminded her, “I think we must remember
that our _déjeuner_ will be served in just five minutes.”

Normandy cider and clotted cream were among the other local delicacies
offered them, and so refreshed were they by their good repast that they
decided to start out again immediately, making their way through the
older and more tortuous streets to the river where they would find a
car for Bonsecours. This took them to a height which overlooked the
valley and the town, and here they could gaze upon the memorial to
Jeanne d’Arc, that statue which represents the young peasant in all her
girlish simplicity. For an hour they lingered, lounging on the grass
and looking down on the valley below, reading snatches of legend and
history from the book they had brought. Then they returned to wander
about the quaint old streets, up the Rue de la Mesure, and down the Rue
Damisette, hanging over the enticing shop windows and gazing upon the
Grosse Horloge, then to step in to view St. Ouen by afternoon light and
to buy bits of Rouenese faience on their way up the Rue de Romain.

A second visit to the cathedral brought them unexpectedly the next
morning upon the market place where the Normandy peasants were crying
their wares and where fresh fruits and vegetables, meats and fish,
rabbits, pigeons, ribbons, laces, clothing and books, jostled each
other on the stands. Their exit was made through a huge old archway
which framed the market scene appropriately as they looked back.

More churches, St. Maclou, exquisite in its symmetry and its beautiful
carvings, St. Godard and St. Patrice with their splendid stained glass,
St. Vincent with its little laborer standing on the outside of one of
the buttresses, and looking out over the river. Then again to take a
parting look at St. Ouen and the great cathedral, a last glance at the
Tour de Beurre, at the beautiful Cour d’Albane, and then to turn with
a sigh from all that Rouen represented, feeling that rich in history,
legend and architecture, and lovely in situation as the city was, they
would have missed much in passing it by, for it would remain as one of
the treasured memories of their trip.




CHAPTER XVI

A GOOD CROSSING


It was not without trepidation that the three travellers embarked
at Dieppe. Visions of a long and rough passage across the Channel
arose before them and they watched the receding shores of France
momentarily expecting an attack of _mal de mer_, but the sea was as
smooth as a mill pond and all their fears were groundless, for a less
eventful, monotonous and easy trip could not be imagined. There was the
inevitable long wait for the customs at Newhaven, but they had reached
an English-speaking country and began to experience a homelike feeling
before even the Sussex downs came in sight. It was late when they
reached London, but it was not difficult to bargain for a four wheeler,
and they felt the sombre dignity of London’s streets as soon as they
had passed out of the station, and had turned toward the great centre
for American tourists, Russell Square.

“This lovely cab system,” said Gabriella, sinking back comfortably,
“is such a boon to the traveller voyaging into the unknown. Why don’t
we import it with a few other things? Imagine only paying two or three
shillings to go this distance. When we cram our cars as full as we
can get them so there is not even standing room, why don’t we clamor
for cheap cabs? It is ridiculous to be satisfied with such miserably
uncomfortable or expensive ways of getting about as we endure. I shall
lobby for a bill to settle cab rates as soon as I get home, and thereby
receive the undying gratitude of my fellow countrymen.”

“Gabriella is always going to do such wonderful things,” remarked
Sidney. “One would think she meant to revolutionize the entire world to
hear her. Doesn’t London seem quiet after Paris? London! Is it really
true that we are here? We aren’t dreaming, are we?”

“No more than we were in Rome or Paris,” returned Miss Cavendish.

“I shall be dreaming very soon,” declared Gabriella. “Let me but find a
pillow upon which to rest my weary head, and I will do all the dreaming
necessary for the occasion. It is very dim and hazy and Londonish,
isn’t it? But, oh, what a comfort it is going to be when we can gabble
out our difficulties in our own tongue to some friendly bobby. I am
eager for the fray. Will our landlady drop her h’s and will there be
a Boots and a slatternly maid such as we always read about in English
novels?”

“Let us hope the slatternly maid at least will be left out,” returned
Miss Cavendish. “We shall soon know, for I think this is our street.”

As they drew up before the door from every house within the square
arose the clangor of gongs. “Does that mean dinner, or is it their
way of welcoming us?” asked Gabriella, as she gathered up her bag and
umbrella.

“Presumably it is dinner,” answered Miss Cavendish.

“Then ho, for the roast beef, the mighty joint and the staying
pudding,” said Gabriella, as she stepped upon the pavement.

“The room is beastly and the bed is a rotter,” was the girl’s comment
after they had been shown their apartments.

“Why, Gabriella Thorne,” exclaimed her roommate, shocked at the
expressions.

“That is purely English,” was the calm response. “I have even heard
Miss Mildred use those terms, and I have no doubt the king speaks those
very words at times. There are words which we use with freedom but
which they look upon here with horror; I will not mention them lest I
shock the walls of this very dingy room. Is the dressing bureau placed
in front of the window so we may not look out upon the mews, do they
call them?”

“Never mind what they call them. Don’t try to be English in such a
startling manner, or you will terrify me.” And Gabriella followed her
friends down to dinner. The meal was substantial and good; all the
efforts of their landlady were evidently centred upon this department,
for the house itself bore a shabby and neglected look.

“It is rather depressing,” Miss Cavendish admitted, examining their
apartments when they had returned to them, “but we shall be in our
rooms very little of the time, and as we have brought all our luggage
here we may as well stay and see how it impresses us at the end of a
week.” Then they entered upon a discussion as to their plans for the
next day. Miss Cavendish wanted first of all to see Westminster Abbey,
Gabriella was for the National Gallery, while Sidney yearned for a trip
to Windsor and on to Stoke Poges. “It would be so lovely to worship in
that dear little church, and to see the graveyard which inspired Gray’s
Elegy,” she argued.

Miss Cavendish consulted her Baedeker. “But Sidney, dear, if we go
there it ought to be on a day when we can see the State apartments at
Windsor. There is no use in making two bites at a cherry.” So Sidney
yielded and Gabriella compromised by giving up the galleries and by
going to St. Paul’s for the afternoon service and to Westminster in
the morning. Then began their sight-seeing, which they pursued so
systematically and energetically that at the end of two weeks Sidney
looked pale, Miss Cavendish declared that she had mental indigestion,
and Gabriella was so wan and listless that her godmother became
alarmed. The girl had been anxious to occupy her every moment since
their arrival in London and never wanted to be left alone a moment or
to be obliged to spend the day in the house even when the others were
glad of a respite from the continual sight-seeing. Though they might be
exhausted she would urge them to further effort and wherever they went
the graceful little figure of Gabriella was always in the lead.

“We all need a change,” Miss Cavendish declared. “We have gone so
steadily since we came here; it has been warm, and we have walked such
distances looking at pictures and museums and such things that I think
it would be best to fly London for a time. What do you say, girls, to a
week by the sea? Miss Bailey is very urgent in begging us to join her
and her sister at that quiet little place in Sussex, so why not go? It
will do us all a world of good.”

Gabriella immediately brightened at the prospect. “I should like it of
all things,” she answered.

“Do you think we can get in anywhere?” Sidney asked. “You know
everybody leaves London in August, and we have been told that all the
watering places are simply packed.”

“We will see what we can do,” was the reply. “I will write to Miss
Bailey at once and see if we can secure lodgings.”

“Lodgings? Real lodgings where you have a sitting-room and have your
meals served as you choose?” Sidney was interested.

“All that.”

[Illustration: “‘THERE IS A LITTLE OLD CHURCH NEXT TO CROSBY HALL ...
AND WE SHALL WANT TO SEE THAT.’”]

“Oh, how delightful. Can we do our own marketing?”

“I imagine so.”

“Then do let us go. I think it will be a delightful change. I will look
up the Windsor Castle route while you are writing, for we might not
be able to get that in when we come back to London and ought to do it
before we go. To-day we go to the City and hunt up that old Crosby Hall
and lunch there, isn’t that the plan?”

Miss Cavendish replied affirmatively and prepared to write her letter
to Miss Bailey.

Their frequent rides on top of a ’bus had familiarized them with London
streets and they had become nimble in climbing up and down and in
distinguishing the proper words: “Piccadilly Circus,” “Oxford Street,”
or “Bayswater” among the maze of signs which advertised Nestle’s Food,
Van Houten’s Cocoa and the like articles. Gabriella generally managed
to get next the driver, and by so going added many an item to their
fund of information. It was she who had discovered that Crosby Hall was
worth visiting. “It is in the old, old part of the city,” she told the
others, “and the name of the streets down that way are fascinating:
Threadneedle Street, Bishopsgate Within, Bartholomew’s Lane. There is
a little old church next to Crosby Hall--St. Helen’s is the name of
it--and we shall want to see that.”

As they stood before the venerable Hall, Miss Cavendish remarked: “And
this was considered at one time to be the finest residence in London.
Shakespeare mentions it in Richard III, and no doubt had dined here
more than once.”

“When it was a palace and not a restaurant,” returned Sidney. “It is
certainly a fine old building and I suppose we should be thankful it
has been preserved even for its present uses.”

“I don’t object to the uses,” declared Gabriella, “not when we can get
such excellent chops as we shall probably find here.” They passed into
the lobby and up the steps into the great banquet hall where, under a
noble Gothic roof, they seated themselves and gave themselves up to a
carnal enjoyment of the excellent food that was provided them, Miss
Cavendish meanwhile offering morsels of the history relating to the
building, which she found in a small book which had been presented to
her as they entered. “It was built in 1466 by Sir John Crosby,” she
gave her information between sips of ale from a quaint mug. “Afterward
it belonged to Richard III. ‘Here,’ says my little book, ‘were hatched
those intrigues which enabled the wily Richard to secure the crown.’ It
goes on to say that the situation of the Hall was favorable, for it is
near the Tower where the two little princes were murdered and--”

Gabriella laid down her knife and fork. “And to think we poor
commonplace persons sit here eating mutton chops,” she said, looking
around the room with a new interest.

“Sir Thomas More also lived here,” Miss Cavendish went on. “There is
a list of the notables who were occupants at different times. Queen
Elizabeth was a guest.”

“It seems much more intimate to eat in a place like this than merely
to look at it,” remarked Sidney. “You feel a certain personal sense of
possession when your chops have been cooked in that great fireplace.”

“Then think what a change from a palace to a Non-conformist
meeting-house. Finally it was bought, restored and put to its present
uses.”

“Which are exceedingly good ones,” decided Gabriella.

From the Hall they found their way to the ancient church set back in
an enclosure which one could enter from Crosby Hall, and which they
might have missed if they had not known where to look for it. As early
as 1216 there was a nunnery connected with the church. To this parish
belonged Shakespeare during his residence in London, and was rated in
the parish books for five pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence.

“I wouldn’t have missed it for anything,” said Miss Cavendish
enthusiastically. “It has been one of our pleasantest London
experiences. We had an unusual combination of old-time associations
and surroundings with modern service.”

“It gave one a sense of fitness to see all those good-looking
Englishmen with their mugs of ale and their chops, just as one always
imagines them lunching,” said Sidney. “There is something exceedingly
stalwart and dependable in the appearance of most Englishmen, I find.”

Gabriella looked sober and proposed that they finish their day at the
Museum, which was always their stop-gap when nothing else specially
invited. There was one uncanny, red-haired mummy, which Gabriella
declared was perfectly fascinating, and which she never failed to look
for whenever she visited the Museum; this and the Elgin marbles were
her favorite exhibits. Miss Cavendish enjoyed the illuminated missals
and manuscripts of various kinds, while Sidney preferred the scarabae
and the treasures of ancient Egypt.

The early start for Windsor was made on a day when the sun was dimly
shining, but when the air was soft and balmy, yet not too hot. With
many other tourists they were rushed through the rooms of the castle
and were glad to get out again into the open air. “Here and at the
Tower were the only times that I have felt that I belonged to the
common herd,” said Sidney as they issued from the courtyard. “It is
good of them to let us see it at all, I suppose, and I did enjoy it,
but I do dislike to be prodded and poked and urged to come along as if
I were a stupid gaping Cockney who had only an insatiable curiosity for
things which belonged to kings and queens.”

“Never mind, dear little aristocrat, you shall not be crowded at Stoke
Poges,” Gabriella tried to console her.

A short railway journey to Slough, a drive of two miles over
picturesque country roads brought them to the quiet little churchyard
at Stoke Poges. They left their carriage a little way up the road and
wandered across the fields to the church. There were but few other
visitors, and the peaceful solitude was theirs to enjoy. “Could one
imagine a more restful place,” murmured Miss Cavendish.

“Or a more beautiful English landscape,” put in Sidney.

“Or a dearer little church,” said Gabriella. “I could almost write an
elegy myself. It is all here, Gem. I can hear the lowing herds; there
is the ivy-mantled tower, though the moping owl seems to be missing,
but there are the rugged elms and here where we are standing is the
very yew tree’s shade.”

But Sidney had no words for her emotions and she mopped her eyes until
Gabriella asked her if Melancholy had marked her for her own. “I didn’t
suppose,” said Sidney by way of excuse, “that it could stay so exactly
as it must have been when Gray used to come here, and when you find
a thing like this that isn’t in the least disappointing, and that is
as perfectly enchantingly peaceful and lovely as this is, you can’t
help filling up and feeling as if you had realized a dream you never
expected to come true. I suppose I am very incoherent, but I can’t help
it. Don’t let us go back, Gem, till the very last minute. I wish we
could spend days here, a Sunday anyhow, so I could come to this little
church and could steep my soul in the loveliness of it all.”

“You brought the Elegy, I hope,” said Gabriella.

“No, but I can repeat it. You know it was my father’s favorite poem.”
And she began the beautiful elegy, pausing every now and then at an
interruption from one of the others, but at the close they all sat very
thoughtful until Gabriella tip-toed across the grass to the tomb which
enclosed the body of the poet and that of his mother. Here the girl
stood and read the pathetic inscription, and then stooping, gathered a
tiny flower and laid it on the slab.

“The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,” quoted Miss Cavendish, as
the shadows deepened. “We must get back to the ‘madding crowd,’ girls.”

“Oh, but I can’t bear to,” exclaimed Sidney, rising reluctantly. “Don’t
let’s ever go back. Let’s send for our best beloveds and stay here the
rest of our lives.”

A leaf from the ivy-mantled tower, a bit of the yew tree, some
photographs, and better than all, a sweet and lasting memory they
carried away with them. Windsor Castle, in all its magnificence, filled
their thoughts with less joy than did the quiet little churchyard set
in the lush green of an English landscape.

“One doesn’t realize till going over the poem,” said Sidney, “how many
ordinary quotations we take from it. I am always surprised myself, well
as I know it. I must try to get an English copy and put my photograph
in it with the ivy leaf and the bit of yew.” This finding of a simple
copy she discovered was not an easy thing to do, and wondered that no
enterprising publisher had seen the need of a cheap edition of proper
size for the photograph, inasmuch as such would find a ready sale.

“London isn’t exactly lovable,” remarked Gabriella, as they passed
through the tranquil streets where rows of sombre houses showed
hazily. “It is dignified and kindly, while Paris is gay and amusing.
It doesn’t seem to be London itself with its smoky atmosphere, and its
general dinginess that one cares for, but it is the associations. It is
altogether too big to be taken into your heart of hearts in the way we
did the little church, yet you do admire it. I feel as if I might live
here for centuries and still have to learn parts of it. We have been
going, going constantly for three weeks, and yet there is much more to
see than when we began, for every day something new turns up. I don’t
believe I should ever care to live in London, but if all rural England
is as charming as that part of it that we saw to-day, I shall love it,
in spite of high walls, iron gates and unresponsiveness in general.”

“I don’t think it is unresponsive,” replied Sidney. “I think it is
merely retiring. I like the way they make a garden of the back yards
and have their tea out there. Why don’t we do such things? The back
gardens are lovely and the people enjoy them as we never do. I think
afternoon tea is a great institution, and have become very dependent
upon it.”

“No wonder, after having had nothing but cold water to drink at
luncheon. With no hot bread for breakfast, but only cold toast and the
eternal bacon and eggs, and for dinner vegetable-marrow, cabbage and
potatoes, I yearn for our American markets,” declared Gabriella. “We
have our advantages at home, and there are some of the English customs
I can never get used to. If I lived here a thousand years I would not
set my dressing bureau with its back to a window, nor would I serve
bacon and eggs for breakfast three hundred and sixty-five times a year.
The back door garden and the afternoon tea go very well, but give me
less grass and a country where you don’t have to grow all your tomatoes
under glass; I am rather dependent upon tomatoes, you remember. I
should like to borrow a cathedral or two, a couple of castles and some
other antiques, but for the rest I shall be quite satisfied to exchange
England for America.”

“You were not so wont to extol our new and raw country,” returned
Sidney with a smile.




CHAPTER XVII

CONFESSIONS


Upon the board-walk of a quiet seaside resort Miss Cavendish and Sidney
were briskly pacing. In front of them were Gabriella and the elder Miss
Bailey in earnest conversation. There were few American tourists to be
seen in this corner of Sussex and Sidney noticed that those who passed
them by turned to look a second time upon Miss Cavendish’s tall figure
in the well-fitting blue serge gown, and gave even more attention to
the girl ahead with the big blue gray eyes and mass of gold brown hair,
the details of her faultless costume betokening her an American. Miss
Mildred had elected to remain in-doors, fearing an attack of neuralgia,
for the weather was cool and the sea air penetrating. Miss Bailey, with
the frugal mind of an Englishwoman, had initiated her friends into the
mysteries of marketing and they were elate at the prospect of enjoying
a carefully selected meal which would appeal to their American tastes
as well as to the appetite which the keen salt wind would sharpen.

The stiff breeze loosened Sidney’s smoothly arranged locks and
fluttered the veil around her hat. She was the neatest of persons,
though she never bore the trig look which was one of Gabriella’s
distinguishing features. “My hair is always limp and straight,” she was
wont to complain. “If it had the lovely ripple that Gabriella’s has,
or even the wave which makes Gem’s manageable, I could get along.” So
now she was tucking back stray locks, which wisped across her face, and
bemoaning the fact that what brought color to Gabriella’s face brought
only freckles to hers.

“Gabriella looks ten per cent better already,” Miss Cavendish remarked.
“We have been going too hard, I am afraid, and London did not agree
with her.”

“I am not sure that it was only London,” returned Sidney.

“Nor I,” responded Miss Cavendish soberly.

Just here Gabriella turned around. “Miss Bailey and I are going back
for tea,” she said. “Will you come with us?”

“Pray come,” urged Miss Bailey. But Miss Cavendish and Sidney declined,
saying that they preferred the sands and would rather watch the
children busy with their sand castles.

“Fancy!” exclaimed Miss Bailey, who would rather go without her dinner
than her afternoon tea.

“Miss Ford said it would be ready for us, and we have some lovely plum
cake,” Gabriella told her companion confidentially. “Do you think that
if we were to stop for Miss Mildred she would come with us?”

“Oh dear, no,” returned Miss Bailey. “She has two or three friends in
the same house and will take her tea with them, I am sure.”

They continued their walk to the unpretentious cottage where Miss
Bailey had found lodgings for Miss Cavendish and her girls. The
sitting-room looked cheerful and homelike. It had pots of blooming
flowers in the windows and the table was spread for tea. A gay
cosey covered the tea-pot and the thin slices of bread and butter
supplemented by a loaf of plum cake made an enticing array. “I believe
I am hungry,” said Gabriella, taking her place at the table.

“That’s a surprise to you, isn’t it?” said Miss Bailey, accepting the
cup which Gabriella handed her.

“Rather, for I had so little appetite in London. Perhaps it is because
I have been walking in the wind, or perhaps it is because it is so
cosey to be pouring out tea at what is a home table for the time being.”

Miss Bailey sipped her tea thoughtfully. “Have you heard from Owen
Morgan?” she asked suddenly.

Gabriella paled and set down her cup with trembling hand. “No,” she
answered after a pause.

“Didn’t you expect to?” Miss Bailey viewed her with a little smile.

A second pause before the “No” was repeated.

“But, my dear, why not? I was sure, there in Paris, that all was going
smoothly, and Mildred and I have talked of it constantly. We were so
happy for Owen. Poor boy, he has missed his mother sadly, though I have
tried to be a mother, and Milly a sister to him, so far as we could.”

The tears rushed to Gabriella’s eyes, and though she tried to wink them
away, one stole from beneath her downcast lids, and before she could
dash it away it was observed.

“Why, my dear,” there was tender concern in Miss Bailey’s tones, “have
you quarrelled? Has anything happened to vex you?”

“No, we haven’t quarrelled,” Gabriella’s voice faltered, “but we--we
have agreed not to see each other again.”

“Oh!” Miss Bailey finished her tea. “You are not eating anything after
all, Gabriella; I may call you so, may I not? It is such a pretty name.”

“Oh, please, yes; I should like to have you.” She hastily consumed a
slice of bread and butter in silence.

“Will you cut me a slice of the cake, please?” asked Miss Bailey.

“Oh, I beg your pardon.” The girl gained her self-control. “I am a very
awkward and thoughtless hostess. Have some tea, Miss Bailey. Please do,
and won’t you take some jam?”

“I never take jam to my bread except at breakfast,” returned Miss
Bailey, “but I should like the cake, please and a cup of tea.”

Gabriella gave her attention to the dear lady, but her own tea grew
cold and she left her cake untasted.

Miss Bailey ate her slice to the last crumb with evident enjoyment. “It
does make one hungry to walk in the salt air,” she remarked.

“Shall we go back then, and get up an appetite for our dinner?” said
Gabriella, rising.

Miss Bailey put out a detaining hand. “Wait a minute, my dear, I want
to talk to you. Please forgive me if I seem to be interfering with
what may appear to be none of my concern, but I stand in place of Mr.
Morgan’s mother; he is my godson, and whatever Mildred and I possess
will be his when we are gone. His happiness is very dear to us. I tell
you this, because I know how many charming Americans marry wealth, and,
though I do not attribute mercenary motives to you, I thought perhaps a
young man with nothing but his profession might seem ineligible to you
who must have had many excellent offers. It is comfortable to have the
assurance, sometimes, that one may expect to be outside poverty. As for
character, you might search the world over, and not find a young man
with better morals.”

“Oh, I know it, I know it,” murmured Gabriella, sinking down on the
floor and burying her face in Miss Bailey’s purple satin lap.

“He is just such a young man,” Miss Bailey continued, “as I should like
to have seen Mildred marry, but you know her story, perhaps. She was
engaged to a young curate who died just as he was looking forward to
an excellent living which would be vacant the coming spring, when they
were to have been married.”

“Oh, no, I never heard that,” said Gabriella, lifting her face and
remembering with compunctions her tart little speeches about Miss
Mildred.

“As I was remarking,” Miss Bailey went on, hastily, “it is not money
alone which brings happiness, though one would wish to be sure of
comfort.”

“It isn’t I who am looking for money, who cares for riches; it is all
on his side,” Gabriella’s words tumbled out eagerly yet confusedly. “It
is all on his side,” she repeated. “I refused him because I believed he
thought me an heiress and I thought he would never have been attracted
to me unless he had thought I possessed a fortune. I haven’t a penny.
I am as poor as a church mouse, and I would be a conceited, heartless
idiot if I should make such an announcement as that I would marry only
a wealthy man.”

“You’ll have to explain, you know,” said Miss Bailey. “I couldn’t
understand unless you did, could I? Mr. Morgan never thought you were
wealthy. He knew it was Miss Shaw who would inherit a fortune from her
grandfather.”

“He knew?” Gabriella lifted an agitated face.

“Certainly.”

“Who told him?”

“I did. We met some Americans who had seen you in Florence and who
recognized all of you.”

“Oh, dear!” Gabriella’s head again dropped. “Then I am more kinds of an
idiot than I supposed,” she murmured. But gladness was tugging at her
heart, and when Miss Bailey, with a timid and cautious gesture, laid
her hand on the girl’s hair she caught it and rested her cheek against
it.

“You will explain, won’t you?” repeated Miss Bailey. “Owen would never
take you from your mother, you know, and would be perfectly willing to
live in America if you preferred, though we have been hoping you could
all be persuaded to make your home nearer us. We have talked it over
many times, Mildred and I, and we thought since there were but the
two of you it might not be difficult to arrange. Of late, however, we
have been having such very depressed letters from our boy, and we knew
something must have gone wrong. I told Mildred, that at the risk of
being thought meddlesome, I meant to question you. You won’t be vexed
with me, will you?”

“No, indeed, I will not, and I will try to explain as well as I can.
What I have to tell is not very much to my credit, Miss Bailey, and
perhaps after you have heard and realize what a silly goose I am, you
will be glad that I decided not to see--not to see--your godson again.”
Then she faltered forth her tale, which Miss Bailey interrupted once
or twice with “Fancy!” or “Really!” but made no other comment. “So you
see,” said Gabriella in conclusion, “it is quite impossible for him
to believe in me again. Either he must think I deliberately tried to
mislead him, in which case he must have no respect for me, or he must
think me too silly to live.”

“But my dear, he thinks neither. He has laughed with us more than once
at your little joke, and has said how well you carried it off. He
understood the situation from the first.”

“And I have been going about saying the English had no sense of humor,”
murmured Gabriella.

“I may be obtuse,” Miss Bailey went on to say, “and I may be pushing
my interference further than I have a right, but if I do you must not
be vexed because of my plain speaking, it is all because I cannot bear
that the ocean should divide you two if you love each other.”

“Neither can I,” came in muffled tones from the enveloping folds of
the purple satin. There was a sound of voices at the outer door.
Gabriella sprang to her feet. “There comes Gem,” she exclaimed. “Dear
Miss Bailey, oh, dear Miss Bailey, how I love you.” She leaned over and
bestowed a rapturous kiss upon the good lady’s cheek, to the evident
embarrassment of the recipient, who was unused to such spontaneity,
though she found voice to say: “It is coming out as it should, my dear.
Have patience,” before Miss Cavendish and Sidney entered the room.

“We changed our minds,” announced the latter. “It grew so cold that we
had the shivers and the more we thought of a cup of hot tea the more
alluring it seemed.”

“I am afraid it is cold, now,” said Gabriella, lifting off the cosey
and examining the tea.

“Send out and have a fresh supply made,” suggested Miss Cavendish, and
Gabriella obeyed.

“What have you been doing to my girl?” whispered Miss Cavendish to Miss
Bailey, “she looks as if she had seen a vision.”

Miss Bailey smiled and over a third cup of tea she let Miss Cavendish
into the secret of Gabriella’s altered looks.

From that hour both Miss Bailey and Miss Mildred seemed more than
ordinary friends. Miss Mildred, more effusive than her sister,
fluttered up to Gabriella that evening and clasped the girl’s hands
in her bony, beringed ones, with such real cordiality that Gabriella,
with a remembrance of former speeches, felt ashamed and responded
by throwing her arms around Miss Mildred and kissing her warmly.
There was another long and confidential talk with Miss Bailey while
the Pierrots were singing their jocular songs on their stand by the
board-walk. To Gabriella, whose thoughts were far away, “For I’se a
little burgu-urgu-lar,” came but dully, but many times in after years
there would arise before her the memory of a long stretch of sand, a
beating sea, a row of Chinese lanterns swinging gaily, and the dancing
Pierrots. She had put her trust in Miss Bailey and was content to wait
results.

That evening she lingered in the sitting-room after Sidney had gone
upstairs. Miss Cavendish sat by the table, the light of the lamp
falling upon her expressive face and touching one or two glistening
threads in her dark hair. There was an air of dignified repose, of
controlled emotion about her that soothed Gabriella’s storm-tossed
soul. She stood behind her and softly stroked the smooth cheek whose
youthful outline had not disappeared. “Gem dear, you are very good to
look upon,” she said.

Miss Cavendish drew down the slim little hand and kissed it. “Come
around here, sweetness,” she said. “It is good to look upon a girl who
has found her roses here by the sea. So the world is not a desert waste
any longer, Gabriella?”

Gabriella seated herself upon the arm of the big chair. “No, there is
a faint indication of a silver lining to my cloud, though I am not so
dead certain but that it will break in thunders on my head yet. I don’t
dare to be too happy, Gem.”

“Take all the happiness you can get, dear. The day may come when you
will be glad you did.”

“But don’t you think I am very poor-spirited, that I am a weak,
wishy-washy flabby animal to let Miss Bailey know I cared? Shouldn’t I
have had more pride?”

“No, no,” Miss Cavendish spoke with emotion. “Pride has caused the
downfall of many a hope; it has blotted out the plan of many a home; it
has turned to ashes many a fire on the hearth. If it had not been for a
matter of pride I might have been priestess of the fires in my own home
to-day, Gabriella.”

“Tell me, dearest Isabella.”

“It was about ten years ago that I sent a letter which was never
received. It gave my address in a city to which I was going and which
was the home of the man I loved. At first I was angry, hurt, mortified
because my letter was not answered, and, when, months after, I
discovered that it had not reached its destination, instead of writing
to explain, I told myself that if my friend had cared very much he
would have found me anyhow. On his side it was argued that I did not
care to see him again, that I had been only trifling with the man who
had offered me his love. I learned these facts years after, when he had
left that part of the country and when it was too late.”

“And that is why--”

“Why I am Isabella Cavendish? Yes. I am very content, however; I have
many interests. But he was a good man, and I might have been first in
some one’s life instead of always finding only second place at best.”

“Did he ever know?”

“I have no reason to believe he did. The friend who explained the
mystery to me is long since dead, and the man to whom I gave a half
promise one summer night has drifted out of my life.”

“But you may meet again. Perhaps it is not too late even now.”

“The world is wide, dear, and our ways are divided. I do not even know
where he is, for he went to the far west before I lost all knowledge
of him. I tell you this, to reassure you, to let you see how slight a
thing may stand in the way of one’s truest joy. Let us not speak of
this again. I have lived it down.”

Gabriella kissed her good-night and went thoughtfully to her room,
feeling glad that she had let Miss Bailey have a glimpse of the heart
whose troubles she had striven to hide.

For the rest of the week there were quietly happy times; afternoon tea
over against the sand dunes when the glory of the western sky shot the
little river with red and gold; long walks to rustic villages where
gray Norman towered churches nestled in the midst of thatched cottages
whose gardens were gay with blooms. Sometimes a tea garden would be
discovered in one of these, and surrounded by a riot of flowers, the
party of five or six would regale themselves upon tea and cakes. Again
it would be a trip to see one of England’s finest castles, the seat of
the Duke of Norfolk at Arundel, where the swift Arun rushes by on its
way to the sea, the castle overtopping the hill that sets a climb for
those who, having reached the bridge, gaze admiringly at the old feudal
stronghold perched above them.

“The town travels uphill all the way,” said Sidney, who, breathless,
was first to gain the summit and look back upon the sparkling
green-bordered river, the scattered farm-houses, the nearer bridge, and
the distant towns.

“The castle itself is not open, you know,” said Miss Bailey, the next
to arrive at the top, her English habit of walking adding to the
sturdiness of her appearance as well as to the ease with which she was
able to mount the hill. “But the park is quite free to visitors,” she
added, “and it is most delightful.” And delightful indeed they found
it. The great grey castle, the central pile of magnificence around
which were the softer beauties of green sward and forest, lake and
stream, serving as offsets to the massive walls which ended in “turrets
old in story.”

“It is surely very impressive,” Miss Cavendish gave her verdict, “and
its setting is beyond compare.”

“All those battlements and turrets and towers and fortifications make
one hark back to the old knightly days,” said Sidney. “It must have
had a great history.”

“It has shared in most of England’s important events,” Miss Bailey told
her. “The Earls of Arundel were Norman barons, and naturally they were
to the front in matters of difference with the king. It was besieged
and surrendered to Henry I, endured a second siege from King Stephen,
while the Cavaliers and Roundheads each struggled for its possession,
and the Parliamentary troops left it in ruins.”

“I am glad when they restored it that they took care to leave some of
the ruins so as to make it more interesting, a sort of hall-mark of
antiquity, as it were,” said Gabriella. “We have an Anne Arundel County
in our state of Maryland,” remarked she. “It was named for the wife of
Caecilus Calvert.”

“Really?” Miss Bailey was interested.

“Maryland was a Roman Catholic settlement, though the freest of them
all,” Gabriella went on, “and I believe the Dukes of Norfolk have
always been Romanists.”

“Always, and the present duke is very zealous. He is at the head of the
Roman Catholic party in England. It was he who gave the cathedral you
can see through the trees. If we have time we can stop there on our way
back.”

But they did not have time, for the delights of Swanbourne Lake, where
the lone cry of a moor hen alone broke the silence, the deep solitude
of the upper park, where hundreds of deer were feeding, the wonderful
beauty of landscape on every side, so enchanted them that they lingered
too long for anything further than a visit to the old parochial church
shut out from the influence of a Roman Catholic domain by a high wall.
It was found to be rich in stained glass and invited an interest only
second to that of the castle itself. On their way through the town the
party had glimpses of gable-roofed, Elizabethan houses, and caught
sight through open doorways of interiors whose quaint old pieces of
furniture were displayed against backgrounds of brilliant color where
gardens smiled beyond the portals. They longed to linger, but the
swift-flowing Arun called them to follow its course to the sea, and
they returned with fine appetites for a supper of fried mullets caught
fresh from the river.

This was their last excursion in Sussex, for the whole party returned
the next day to London, where they parted company, the Baileys going
on to visit friends in Derbyshire before they should go to their own
home, and Miss Cavendish with her girls ready to start on their trip to
Scotland and the English lakes.




CHAPTER XVIII

ST. GILES’S FAIR


There was a great gathering of townspeople and country people in the
old town of Oxford. “What can be going on?” exclaimed Miss Cavendish,
who, with her girls, was turning the corner by old St. Michael’s
Church. She stopped to question a gaping countryman, who looked at her
open-mouthed. What benighted being was this who could be upon the spot
and not know about St. Giles’s Fair? But he gathered sufficient pity
and understanding to tell them what they wanted to know.

“We must ask Mrs. Birch about it when we get back from market,” said
Sidney. This attending to their own marketing was a great frolic,
and one which added zest to their appetites when meal-time came. The
market offered fresh country vegetables and fruit and was an attractive
little place to the three who had come to regard bacon and eggs as a
dish to be avoided when possible. Here they could select according to
the taste of each and were always very content. Having completed this
duty, they went back to their lodgings to give their orders and to gain
information.

“Yes, ma’am, thank you, ma’am,” said their landlady. “I’ll do the
mushrooms for your luncheons, and ’ow would you like your heggs, miss?”

“They’d be good scrambled, wouldn’t they?” suggested Sidney.

“You may scramble them, Mrs. Birch,” said Miss Cavendish. But the
good woman looked mystified; she had never ’eard of scrambled heggs.
“Stirred eggs,” suggested Miss Cavendish. But this method seemed
no more familiar to Mrs. Birch than the other, there were further
explanations and at last a gleam of intelligence flashed from Mrs.
Birch’s eye. “Hit’s buttered heggs you mean, miss, thank you, miss.”
And thereafter buttered eggs became a part of their bill of fare.

St. Giles’s Fair, they were told, was not what it had been; it was a
noisy, foolish performance which Mrs. Birch doubted if the ladies would
care to see, but if they should like a glimpse of it the evening would
be the liveliest. Therefore they bided their time till night should
fall, and meanwhile they occupied themselves with the treasures of the
Bodleian Library, peeped in at Tom Quad, took a hasty view of the ivied
walls of Pembroke and other colleges which they would examine more
closely later on.

“I almost hate to leave our comfortable sitting-room,” said Sidney with
a regretful look at the lighted lamp and the open piano. “I have been
in no such homelike place since I left America.”

“We’ll have our homelike places all back again soon enough,” replied
Gabriella, “but we shall not be able to see St. Giles’s Fair.”

Therefore they started out and elbowed their way through a throng of
jostling men and women who had come a-fairing, and soon they found
themselves in the very centre of the excitement. Side shows were
everywhere, calliopes, street pianos, brazen horns, fairly deafened
them; and the vendors of nostrums and novelties crying their wares
added to the Babel of noise. For the rest, be it said, it was a quiet
crowd. There was little boisterous merriment, no loud-voiced, piercing,
nasal conversation. Indeed, it was ludicrously “unnoisy,” Gabriella
said. “The English have a silent way of taking things, anyhow,” she
remarked. “If a man gets angry with his wife, and chucks her out of
the house, he growls something in an undertone, you hear a dull thud
and that is all. One day in London I happened to hear two men who were
having an altercation; you could see by their set faces that they were
simply boiling mad inside, but all that I heard in the very lowest
pitched, contemptuous tones was ‘You are a wehm,’ from one man, and
the other one said in quite the same manner: ‘If I am a wehm, you are
a loathsome wehm,’ and that was all of it; vituperation could go no
further than to call a man a loathsome worm. Oh, do look, Gem.”

Miss Cavendish turned her head to see a quartette of girls with long
wands in their hands; the wands were tipped with something fuzzy with
which they touched the faces of such chance young man as took their
fancy, and the swain returned the attention by flinging a handful of
flour upon the damsel. In some cases when the little wand was too
persistently used the young woman was caught and kissed, though,
unlike an American girl upon such a provocation, she neither struggled
nor shrieked, neither did she laugh loudly. Her friends might giggle
softly, but the whole performance was so matter-of-fact, there was such
a spirit of imperturbability evidenced that Sidney and Gabriella were
amused beyond measure.

“It is the very funniest thing we have seen,” Sidney declared. “Imagine
such a scene at one of our county fairs. Picture one of our American
girls under similar circumstances and fancy her shrill laughter, her
high-pitched protestations and all the rest of it. All the noise upon
this occasion is made by those very unmusical instruments, and those
clap-trappers.”

A short survey of the fair served them, and they returned to their
lodgings, caring little for merry-go-rounds, Punch and Judy shows,
jugglers and charlatans.

“I am afraid I am fickle,” announced Gabriella as they entered the
cosey apartment. “I am beginning to feel myself false to Italy because
I am realizing the delights of clean English lodgings. Fancy being
able always to live in a beautiful old historic English town with
green meadows and winding streams at your very door, and of having
the comforts of home with no bother of servants; of being able to
do your own marketing and of feeling sure that your food will be
served and cooked perfectly and your rooms kept in exquisite order
by a soft-voiced, respectable woman who never is supercilious nor
condescending, but who, on the contrary, is humbly delighted that
you favor her house with your presence. It is such an entirely new
sensation that I am wondering if it isn’t the very idealest existence
of any.”

“Shall you take out naturalization papers to-morrow?” asked Sidney.

“Not quite so soon; I haven’t seen Scotland yet.”

“Nor Wales.”

A vivid blush overspread Gabriella’s cheek. “Please spare a trembling
maid,” she begged. “Have pity upon my condition of uncertainty and
dread.”

Sidney laughed and picked up her shining brass candlestick, remarking
that she had letters to write.

Oxford was left behind with reluctance. It was tantalizing not to be
able to wander down Addison’s walk more than once, not to become more
than half familiar with “the noblest old street in England,” nor to
linger more leisurely in the sweet gardens and the dignified college
halls. Yet, with passage taken for a settled sailing, time was pressing
and there was still much which they felt they could not leave out of
their trip. Warwick and Stratford-on-Avon held them for two or three
days, then, as they journeyed on from Lincoln to York and Durham, their
enthusiasm waxed warmer and warmer as the cathedral towns led them from
glory to glory.

“I don’t believe either of the others can be finer than Lincoln,”
declared Gabriella. “I have made my choice and nothing will budge me.
Where will you find anything as beautiful as that Angel Choir, where
anything as grotesque as that dear little imp? Where shall we see such
a wonderful vaulting as that which springs from that single shaft in
the Chapter House? And surely nothing can rival its site at the top of
that mighty hill overlooking the Witham. I may appear obstinate to you
after this, but Lincoln has my heart and I shall not give it to either
York or Durham.”

York was reached that same night, for it was intended to make the most
of time and to reach Durham early the next afternoon, take a hasty view
of the cathedral and arrive in Edinburgh that same evening, it being
Saturday.

“I have the address of a well recommended hotel,” said Miss Cavendish,
fumbling in her bag for her address book. “We will go there. It is
very near the station, I was told, so we can walk.” But though they
wandered about for half an hour, the small hotel seemed to have lost
itself utterly, for no trace of it could they discover and could
find no one who knew it. At last they were directed to an inn which
presented a very attractive exterior, fresh paint and a fine old
doorway giving them the impression that here they would find ease
and comfort. They inquired for rooms, and were told that though the
house was rather full they could be accommodated. A shock-headed youth
escorted them up the stairs, down a hallway and into a back room.

“Dear me,” Miss Cavendish looked at her companions, “I am afraid this
will not do.”

The youth stood stolidly, open-mouthed and unresponsive, but a direct
question brought the information that there was no other room to be had.

“It is too late to look elsewhere,” Miss Cavendish decided.

“But this is a feather bed,” said Gabriella; “we can never sleep on
that this warm night.”

No amount of questioning seemed to bring any suggestion to the vacant
brain of Boots. When he did venture upon the semblance of a sentence
it was in such unintelligible Yorkshire dialect that he might as well
have saved himself speech. At last Miss Cavendish inquired, “Is there
a chambermaid?” There was. “Send her to me.” To their relief the
chambermaid was a brisk capable body who took in the situation. It was
true that there was no other room vacant. The town was quite full, and
the hotels were pressed to their utmost capacity. The feather bed could
be removed and placed underneath the mattress if the ladies wished.
“Where’s that Boots?”

After some moments Boots reappeared, looking wholly scared, dense and
stupid, but his arms were muscular if his tongue was rusty and it
appeared to be little trouble to make such changes as should give the
travellers a hope of a good night’s rest.

The breakfast was execrable and the price charged by an over pious
text-quoting landlady was not modest. “Next time I arrive in York it
will be daylight,” decided Miss Cavendish as they took their departure
from the house.

“Yet,” returned Gabriella, “I wouldn’t have missed Boots for anything.
He answers so perfectly to my ideal of a thick-headed Yorkshire bumpkin
that I am satisfied to have met him under such circumstances rather
than to have had him left out of my life. He is the most deliciously
earth-born churl I have ever encountered. That shock head, that gaping
mouth, those lustreless eyes, that vacant stare, when shall we ever
meet their like again?”

“But there’s the Minster,” exclaimed Sidney as they approached the
great cathedral after their tour of the old city walls. The grand
proportions of the building impressed them all, the fantastic
gargoyles especially pleased Gabriella. Sidney was delighted with
the beautiful stained glass, Miss Cavendish was enthusiastic over the
Chapter House. They had walked the length and breadth of the immense
interior, had entered the crypt, and had examined many of the details
of the cathedral’s beautiful interior by the time the hour of twelve
warned them that they must soon leave.

“Stop,” whispered Sidney, “something is going to happen.” In the vast
aisles a grave company was assembling. From the chancel wound a long
procession of clergy and singers chanting a miserere which echoed
through the vast transept toward which the procession was moving. Then
through the door, from the bright September weather outside was borne
a bier. That this was an occasion of more than usual solemnity the
appearance of all indicated. This was the funeral of an esteemed member
of the clergy. There were vested priests and choir boys, long-veiled
deaconesses and members of guilds. The slow cortège proceeded up the
church and with the echoing minor notes of the music in their ears the
three Americans stepped out into the sunshine and life from which the
old canon had just been borne.

“It was the climax,” whispered Sidney. “Wasn’t it wonderful to see
that solemn procession, to hear that heart-breaking music in that most
wonderful of cathedrals? You may have Lincoln, Gabriella, but for my
part I am overpowered by the beauty of York.”

The train soon bore them to their next stopping-place, “Durham’s
Gothic shade,” and here Miss Cavendish became eloquent and declared
her allegiance given. “It is so splendidly and simply Norman. Look at
those ponderous columns, that combination of mightiness and simplicity,
and to think that here lie the bones of the Venerable Bede and of
St. Cuthbert. Then its history. Think of the Prelate of Durham so
splendidly placed in his fortress, really a sovereign who was rivalled
by only one other, the Bishop of Ely on his island. Then there is that
pretty legend of how the monks of Lindisfarne were led to the site by
a dun cow. You may have your Lincoln imp, Gabriella, it just suits
you, but give me the staid and historic dun cow. As soon as we get to
Edinburgh I shall sally forth and buy a copy of Scott’s poems. You
remember in ‘Marmion’ that it says:

  “‘And after many wanderings past
    He chose his lordly seat at last
    Where his cathedral huge and vast,
    Looks down upon the Wear.’”

“So this is the Wear,” said Sidney, “and a beautiful site it is indeed
for a cathedral. I am almost tempted to grant that it satisfies me as
well as York, yet it doesn’t quite.”

“How satisfactory it is for each of us to have a different cathedral,”
said Gabriella; “it makes it much more interesting.”

“Gem must have a little mooly cow to match your imp,” said Sidney. And
when they left the town a tiny silver effigy of Durham’s historic dun
cow was hanging from Miss Cavendish’s lorgnette chain. To Gabriella
Sidney had already presented the most grotesque imp that Lincoln could
furnish, and for her own satisfaction she had a pile of photographs of
York Minster.

They climbed the hill to the railway station, well pleased that they
had not left out of their trip the three cathedral towns which had
given them such delight. “I wish we could have seen other cathedrals,”
Miss Cavendish remarked as they left Durham behind them.

“Oh, but consider how hopelessly mixed up we would be,” returned
Gabriella. “Now each of us is entirely satisfied, for we have just one
apiece; there is no dividing of our affections, no half-heartedness in
the devotion each gives to her own. Possibly there may be others as
fine as Lincoln, but I shall never know it, and I am happy.”

“I will venture to say that there is none with a more romantic history,
nor which has such literary associations as Durham,” rejoined Miss
Cavendish.

“And I don’t believe there is such stained glass in any of them as
in York,” Sidney put in, and then they laughed and settled back in
their places to look upon the fast-fading landscape. Along a cold but
interesting coast their route lay for most of the journey. Once in a
while they caught glimpses of a steely blue sea, of ships far out, of
stretches of sandy beaches or green clad cliffs, and by nine o’clock
they were in Edinburgh.

A genial old cabman landed them safely at their lodgings in a clean,
comfortable house, from the window of which they could look over the
roofs of houses to the castle which crowned the hill beyond.

“It is going to be fascinating; I feel it,” announced Gabriella, taking
her first peep the next morning from her window. “The dear grey city
is going to enthrall me. It is not so big but that we can take it in
and become friendly with it and its castle. It is a good thing to have
a castle as part of the view, for then you feel as if the city had not
parted with its history; you feel that its links to the past have not
been broken by the sledge-hammer of modernity.”

“Who is making fine speeches?” said Sidney, coming in at that moment.
“We must hurry, mustn’t we? if we want to see the soldiers. We must be
at St. Giles’s by nine, you know. Don’t stop to prink, Gabriella.”

“If there ever was an occasion that called for prinking it is when I am
to attract the gaze of the Black Watch,” returned Gabriella.

[Illustration: “THEY WERE REWARDED BY SIGHT OF A COMPANY UNDER
INSPECTION.”]

“But they’ll get there before we do, if we don’t hurry, and we want to
see them marching in.”

Owing to Gabriella’s prinking they were late and the Highlanders were
in their places by the time the church was reached, so it was not till
after the hearty singing of “Onward, Christian soldiers,” in which all
joined, and the service was over that the girls had their chance of
seeing swinging kilts and swaying bonnets all in line. “Aren’t they
the loveliest ever?” whispered Gabriella as they stood on the pavement
outside. “I’d like to take one home with me just to keep and look at.
See that dickey little officer’s claymore; what a perfect beauty of a
cairngorm he has.”

“We must follow them up to the castle,” declared Sidney, no less eager
than Gabriella. “It is ever so long before it will be time to go to St.
Cuthbert’s, and we’ve nothing else to do.” So up the hill they followed
the swinging line to see the red coats and tartans disappear under the
grey stone gateway. But they lingered to look down from the parapet
upon the town and were rewarded by sight of a company under inspection.

“It is a picture, a perfect picture,” exclaimed Gabriella. “See that
officer coming out from the castle, isn’t he fine? It is the same one
who had that beauty cairngorm.”

“Yes, and he is quite aware that he is a thing of beauty himself,”
remarked Miss Cavendish.

“Never mind, he is a joy forever, and if I could wear a tartan, carry a
claymore, and have such a lovely swinging bonnet as that I’d be puffed
up, too. I don’t blame him one bit. I am afraid, Gem, that I shall
spend all the time we are here in running after the soldiers.”

“I never expected to be crazy over the military,” said Sidney, “but I
must say I never saw anything so fascinating as this uniform, nor a
finer set of men.”

“Come away, come away, you two,” laughed Miss Cavendish, “or you will
lose your wits. It is time we were starting for church if we expect to
hear ‘wee Jimmy McGregor’ preach to-day.” And with many a backward look
they went down the hill to be set upon by a horde of street urchins who
would fain show them the “Boby Burruns” house, but whom they smilingly
passed by.

“You girls are not living up to your opportunities,” Miss Cavendish
reproached her companions. “I don’t believe that you allowed either
your eyes or your thoughts to wander for one moment from those
soldiers. I don’t believe that you appreciated the fact that it was in
St. Giles’s that Jenny Geddes threw her stool at Dean Hanna, nor that
you were near the very site of the Heart of Midlothian when you came
away. You were simply bent upon tagging soldiers and I couldn’t get at
you.”

“We can hear about Jenny Geddes any time,” returned Gabriella, “but
when again will we see Gordon’s Forty-second coming home from service?”

“In the graveyard of St. Cuthbert’s we shall find the graves of De
Quincey and--”

“There goes one,” interrupted Sidney as she caught sight of a swaying
kilt and a pair of bare knees on the other side of the street. And Miss
Cavendish gave up in despair.




CHAPTER XIX

SKIRLING PIPES


It was at Holyrood that the two girls next evinced their mild madness
for kilts and claymores. All morning they had been gathering up a new
vocabulary, conversing excitedly of sporrans and philabegs and calling
one another flickermahoy or tawpie until Miss Cavendish declared they
were fairly daft. They had walked the length of the Old Canongate, had
gazed upon John Knox’s house, had peeped into the filthy yet attractive
second-hand shops which displayed treasures to the searcher for
antiques, had looked upon the squalor and wretchedness of the city’s
poor and had at last made a tour of inspection of ancient Holyrood to
view the room where Rizzio was slain and the place where Mary, Queen of
Scots laid her unhappy head.

It was in one of the rooms associated most intimately with Darnley
that Miss Cavendish, turning to speak to her companions, saw them
both racing toward the door. “Come on! Come on!” they cried and she
followed. Down the stairs ran the girls as if all the ghosts of
Holyrood were after them, nor did they stop even when they had passed
through the gate into the street.

At last, breathless, Miss Cavendish caught up with them. “What is it?”
she cried. “Where are you going?”

“Didn’t you see them? Don’t you hear them?” cried Gabriella, all
excitement. “The soldiers, the pipes; they are drilling back there.”

“I caught sight of them from one of the windows,” gasped Sidney, “and
we had to come. Oh dear, I am afraid we are too late.”

“Not too late to have our heart’s desire fulfilled. They are marching
to the pipes and they will come this way. Oh, I am all of a shiver over
it.” Gabriella’s glowing face bent forward in eager delight brought an
answering gleam to the eye of more than one tall laddie as he marched
by to the music of the pipes. The whole regiment was out, bonnets
tossing, kilts moving in a rhythmic swing. Up the old Canongate they
marched until only a gleam of steel, a touch of red, a twinkling back
and forth of buskined legs could be perceived, and the skirling of the
pipes had become a distant drone.

“Oh, wasn’t it splendid?” sighed Gabriella, brought back to a
consciousness of herself. “I would rather have seen that than all of
the rooms of stupid old Darnley and his ilk. We may go to the castle
this afternoon, mayn’t we, Gem? Perhaps we may see another drill or
parade or something.”

But no such blissful experience was afforded them, and they ended
their day in one of the delightful book-shops where they bought little
tartan-covered volumes of Burns and a quaint old edition of Scott’s
poems. These they bore triumphantly home with them.

“Mrs. McTavish says we must not fail to see the great Forth bridge,”
said Sidney the next morning.

“Then since we are having unusually good weather for Scotland, we may
as well take advantage of it and go this afternoon,” returned Miss
Cavendish. “As for the morning there is always plenty to occupy us if
we do no more than walk up and down Prince’s street.”

“I adore Prince’s street,” remarked Gabriella, “and I adore Edinburgh.
When I get tired of feasting my eyes on lovely tartans and cairngorms
and all sorts of Scotchy things in the shop windows I can look across
at the lovely gardens or up at the castle. Then one sees such a
pleasant mixture of people, nice rosy-cheeked light-haired Scotch girls
in tarns and golf capes, well dressed Americans, dear old Scotchmen in
kilts, and last but not least, the delightful soldiers with their bare
knees and their funny little caps.”

“Speaking of weather,” said Sidney, “although it is rather chilly here,
who could ever have thought that either England or Scotland would
furnish us with so much sunshine? I hope it will continue to the very
end.”

It was cool and bracing down by the water when they reached North
Queensferry where they gazed up at the monstrous structure which
spanned the Firth of Forth. The little village itself was not
important, but they wandered about for an hour, finding small matters
to interest their vigilant eyes. They had planned to cross upon the
ferry-boat and then ride home upon one of the brakes constantly running
to Edinburgh.

“I suppose this must be the wharf where the ferry-boat comes in,” said
Miss Cavendish when they had come to the landing.

“There are two nice looking girls over in that garden,” said Gabriella;
“I will ask them.” She walked a little way up the road, and, looking
over the garden wall, put her inquiries, coming back smiling. “They
say that sometimes it comes in here and sometimes it goes to the other
wharf,” was her report.

“But how are we to tell?” asked Miss Cavendish.

“There is no way; you simply have to watch and when you see that it is
not coming here you must run for it.”

“And how far is the other wharf?”

“Oh, a quarter of a mile or so.”

“Will the boat wait?”

“A wee bitty.”

“But suppose we don’t get there in time.”

“Then that will be the fault of our legs; we couldn’t blame the boat,
you know.”

“Did you ever!” exclaimed Sidney.

The ferry-boat was now leaving the other side, and the attention of
the three, as well as that of the occupants of the garden was fixed
upon the movements of the small steamer. For a time it seemed to be
deliberately heading for them, but of a sudden, when it appeared
certain that the wharf where they stood must be the one selected,
it turned and swept on to the further one. “You’ll have to run,”
called the girls in the garden, and the three took to their heels and
travelled down the road at their best speed. There was a turn ahead of
them and here the boat was lost to sight, but they presently saw it
again; it had reached the wharf. Would it wait? It seemed a very long
quarter of a mile, for they were still at some distance.

“My breath is almost gone,” gasped Miss Cavendish.

“I shall drop,” panted Sidney, falling in the rear. But Gabriella kept
ahead, and presently a cyclist came dashing past. “I’ll tell them to
wait for you,” he called back and the hindmost ones dropped into a
walk while Gabriella stumbled on and finally was assisted, gasping and
exhausted, upon the deck.

“There are two others,” she managed to utter the words, and in a
few moments appeared Miss Cavendish and Sidney almost in a state of
collapse.

But they had made their boat and the very effort gave an added value
to their sight of the great bridge so far above them, and to the
lovely drive back with Hopetoun House and Barnbougle Castle as distant
landmarks.

“It is more than I ever dreamed of having, this glimpse of Scotland,”
said Gabriella as they were packing their trunks that night, “but oh,
Gem, how it does whet one’s appetite for more. I long for Oban and the
skirling pipes, for the Highlands, the Trossachs and the lakes.”

“We shall take some of the lakes from Glasgow.”

“Let us pray for a pleasant day,” said Sidney.

“Of course we shall have a pleasant day,” replied Gabriella. “Haven’t
we always had good weather for all the special things?”

“It was so lovely in Lucerne at the feast of Corpus Christi,” returned
Sidney.

“But that was the only time we had it so dreadfully wet, and there has
to be an exception to prove the rule.”

But alas, for Gabriella’s optimism, the day appointed for the lakes
promised doubtfully enough in the early morning, though a sudden burst
of sunshine just before the time of departure gave them courage to
undertake the trip. For an hour or so there was no rain, but they had
scarcely embarked before the clouds thickened and a drizzle set in.
“It is real typical Scotch weather,” said Miss Cavendish; “we may as
well accept it cheerfully.”

“But why,” said Sidney, gathering her golf cape around her and drawing
her feet under her stool, “why, in all conscience, if this is the
general condition of things, of all countries, must Scotland be the
only one which does not provide a cover for the decks of her steamers?
There is not a dry spot where we can creep except that stuffy cabin
full of crying children.”

“I suppose simply because it is the general state of things no one
minds it,” returned Miss Cavendish. “Everyone prepares for it, and they
are disappointed if they don’t get wet.”

“Then we must continue to sit here with dripping umbrellas over our
heads, golf capes over our knees and our heels in little puddles of
water.”

“I am afraid that is the best we can do.”

“I shouldn’t mind the getting wet so much if we could only see the
landscape,” said Gabriella. “If we must be uncomfortable we should at
least get the benefit of what we came for.”

“You can have the satisfaction of enduring a real Scotch mist.”

“Which I am not at all enthusiastic about,” said Sidney.

“Perhaps it will clear at noon and the coaching part will make up for
this part of the trip,” suggested Gabriella cheerfully.

But the drizzle was constant; the char-à-bancs was no better provided
with a protecting cover than was the steamer, and the dripping
umbrellas were in requisition the entire day. Yet there were
suggestions of magnificent scenery once in a while when the clouds
lifted and they could behold the rolling hills and the stretches of
purple heath beyond the wooded shores of the lovely lake. “It must
be beautiful beyond description,” sighed Sidney, “and it is too
exasperating to feel that you are really here in the heart of this
lovely scenery that we have read about and dreamed about and that this
veil of mist hides everything.”

“And to think we have paid to get soaked and to see only a grey wall of
mist,” said Gabriella chuckling, her sense of fun getting the best of
the situation.

“We might stop off somewhere and try what to-morrow will do for us,”
suggested Miss Cavendish, “though there is no surety that to-morrow
will be any better.”

“Oh, no, we’d better go back and get dry,” said Sidney resignedly.

The journey ended at Glasgow and here letters awaited them. Among these
was a glad and eager one from Gabriella’s mother, who counted the
days till her child’s return. There was also one from Miss Bailey for
Gabriella. She read it through, then thoughtfully folded it. “What do
you think, Gem,” she said, “Miss Bailey asks me to come and make her a
visit. Isn’t she kind?”

“Very. And should you like to go?”

“And desert you? Oh, no. She proposes that you sail without me, but
with this dear letter from my patient little mother, whose longing
pervades every line, with my passage taken and all that, I simply
couldn’t.”

Miss Cavendish made no answer for a moment. “What else does she say?”
she asked presently.

“She says she cannot bear that I should go back with wrong impressions,
that she wants me very much, and that she and Miss Mildred will do all
in their power to make me content and will see that I have a proper
companion for the home voyage. But I shall not go to her, Gem, don’t
think that, and please don’t take me to Wales.”

“I thought that was a place you felt you must see.”

“I did, but now I’d rather cuddle down with you and Sidney in some
restful place for the little time that is left. You are tired out,
although we have not travelled with such distractingly rapid rushes as
some do, and I think we shall be in a better state for our ocean trip
if we take things easy for the next two weeks.”

“Shouldn’t you like to go to Miss Bailey for that time? It would be a
very pleasant experience to enjoy the hospitality of a real English
home, and in that beautiful Devonshire, too.”

But Gabriella shook her head. “She has written to Mr. Morgan, she says,
but has had no reply. I know what she thinks. She believes if I were
to stay that perhaps she could arrange a meeting, that if he knew I
were in England with her it might make a difference, but if he is so
cautious, so deliberate that he must be urged, I would rather never see
him again. I think now that what I want most in the whole world is my
precious mother.”

“Dear child, it will not be long.”

“No, and I am glad. It has been a happy, happy six months, Gem, and I
shall enjoy it all over again, for ‘Who can take from us what has been
ours?’”

Miss Cavendish kissed her softly and drew her down by her. “We will go
down to the Wordsworth country and spend our last two weeks. I have
been going over the route with Sidney, and we could find no spot more
restful and beneficial for our final enjoyment than the English lake
country, I am sure.”

“Let’s find some little village, then; not one of the larger places.”

“That is what I intend to do. I am thinking of Grasmere or Ambleside.”

“Which is the smaller?”

“Grasmere, and it was Wordsworth’s home; there he is buried and there,
too, lived De Quincey and Hartley Coleridge in Nab Cottage. The whole
countryside is full of suggestion.”

“Then do let us go there; it sounds perfectly fascinating.”

“We’ll take a day or two for Keswick and the Derwentwater section and
then go on by coach.”

“Charming. But won’t it be very expensive?”

“Not at all. I am still keeping within my thousand dollars, Gabriella,
and have a good margin. Since we came to England our expenses, yours
and mine, have been only about a hundred and fifty dollars, an average
of about twelve dollars a week, and I am sure we have been comfortable,
have travelled where we liked and have not stinted ourselves.”

“As usual I am lost in admiration of your ability as conductor. Then
we are to start to-morrow for the lakes and after them comes Liverpool
and home. I shall write to dear Miss Bailey that I cannot make her the
visit, for across the ocean there is a little mother longing for the
unworthy daughter who has spent half a year away from her.”

Sidney was awake as Gabriella entered her room. “Did you have good
news, Rella?” she asked.

“Yes, I think so. And you, Sidney?”

“I had better news than usual, for some one will meet me at the steamer
whom I shall be very glad to see.”

“Ah, I can guess; it is the writer of the thick letters.”

Sidney gave a swift amused look at Gabriella. “Yes, it is,” she said.

“Aha! I thought there was something in that. Are you open to
congratulations, Miss Shaw?”

Sidney made no answer, but continued to look with an amused expression
at Gabriella.

“Tell me, you wretched little clam,” Gabriella went on. “I have a mind
to shake you.”

“When one has the dearest, most devoted mother in the world, I think
she is to be very much congratulated.”

“Sidney, you are hedging.”

“Explain yourself.”

“Do you pretend that all your absorbing interest and your eagerness
were given to your mother’s letters?”

“Yes, my romantic friend.”

“And not to a man? Is there no man at all in the case?”

“Yes, there are two; my brother and my grandfather.”

“Oh, pshaw! I don’t believe it.”

“Fact, my dear. I suppose you can’t conceive of such a thing as a girl
of my age never having had a lover except our friend the Dutchman. I
have been more grateful to him than I acknowledged, for he has added
immensely to my self-respect. I never confessed this even to mamma,
Rella, but I did hate to go through life without having had even one
proposal.”

“As if any girl ever did. You are full young yet, and will probably
have dozens before you get through.”

Sidney shook her head. “I’m not the kind that induces them, and I doubt
if I ever have another, but I am mightily uplifted by having had just
that one, and I am perfectly content to go back to my mother and live
my life, for it will now be broidered with memories of this lovely
trip.”

“It has been a lovely trip, hasn’t it? And we have come to know each
other so well. I shall always think of you as one of my best friends. I
hope we shall be comrades all our lives.”

“I hope so, too, Rella. You have been the life of this trip, and I
shall always remember how much you added to my enjoyment of it.”

“That’s awfully sweet of you, Sidney. Do you know what the next part of
the programme is?”

“Yes, Gem and I have been going over our Baedekers together, and I
think we have planned a delightful time.”

“So do I; that doesn’t disappoint me in the least.”

“Does anything?”

“You do; I had counted on a romance coming out of those letters.”

Sidney laughed. “I am satisfied, and if there is any future romance I
am willing to wait for it.”

“In your case the waiting will be easy,” said Gabriella as she blew out
the candle.

At Keswick with its suggestions of Shelley and Southey, they entered
the Lake District to take “the finest drive in the kingdom.” Buttermere
Lake, Borrowdale, Howiston Hawse, and back again to lovely Keswick. An
enthusiastic three they were who occupied the front seats of the coach,
and whose spontaneous admiration of the beautiful district brought an
appreciative smile to the face of the driver.

“Dear, dear,” exclaimed Gabriella, “I am getting back my Italian
sensations and am realizing again the paucity of adjectives in
the English language. Help me out, somebody. Aren’t those beeches
beautiful? And look at the color on that dear little mountain, isn’t it
enough to drive one wild? It is all such a perfect miniature section,
the mountains and lakes and all are so little and yet so perfect. You
feel such a sense of nearness while they are entirely satisfying. Now
at home, if we want to climb a mountain, we can’t go out the back door
after breakfast and get home in time for dinner; and if we want to
cross one of our lakes we must wait for a steamboat. Here you simply
drag out your row-boat from under the bushes and pull across, run up
your mountain and turn round and come back again by supper time; it is
so perfectly dear and friendly and satisfactory.”

“I simply adore the names they have for things about here,” declared
Sidney. “It is so refreshing to get hold of tarns and gills, forces
and becks for the watery places, and combes and hows, nabs and holmes
for the dry ones. We must learn them all, Gabriella. Now what would
that be over there?” she asked the driver.

“That’s Castle Crag, miss. Hit’s between ’Igh Fell and Great ’Ow.”

“Lovely!” exclaimed Sidney. “Do you hear that, Gem?”

“Yes, but I am trying to remember what it is that Wordsworth says about
‘Castrigg’s naked steep.’ We must read up Wordsworth, girls, when we
get to Grasmere.”

“If I am disappointed in Grasmere it will be a dreadful shock,” said
Gabriella. “The very name enchants me, and I have pictured just what
it must be like. Since I have seen Keswick I can better believe that I
shall find the realization of my dreams at Grasmere.”

She was not disappointed, for when the coach swept by the old Swan inn
and down the road to the middle of the little village resting quietly
upon the margin of its lovely lake encircled by mountains they all
looked around in delight. “It is, it is all I have dreamed,” cried
Gabriella. “Oh, Gem, it is as perfect as if it had been made to order.
No inn, please, Miss Gem, but simple lodgings in some cottage; then we
can enjoy every minute in the jewel of a place. I take off my hat to
Wordsworth. Anyone with the good taste to select such a spot to live
in I have the utmost respect for.”

They watched the coaches rattle off down the road and on to Ambleside,
and then they turned their attention to the search for lodgings. It
was so late in the season that these were not difficult to obtain,
though it was not easy to find the ideal place, but at last it was
discovered in a cottage which gave them a garden on one side and green
fields on the other; the highroad and the lake seen through the trees
were in front of them, and behind them, hurrying past the garden wall,
was the river Rothay. Everything about the house was spotlessly clean,
the landlady was the softest-voiced, gentlest of creatures, and they
settled down for their two weeks’ stay with contented hearts.

“Are you perfectly satisfied, Gabriella?” asked Miss Cavendish.

“Satisfied?” echoed the girl, “I am more than that; I am happy.”

“And you would not rather be with Miss Bailey?”

A slight shadow crossed Gabriella’s face, but she answered, “No, this
is Heartsease Cottage, Gem.”




CHAPTER XX

THE OTHER GENTLEMAN


Miss Cavendish sat in a large easy chair pouring over a volume of
Wordsworth. Her fine profile was outlined against the green of growing
plants in the window and the long lines of her graceful figure were
distinctly picturesque in the pose she had taken. Gabriella was at the
table, her pen flying across her sheet of writing paper. It was raining
dismally, but Sidney had gone to the post-office. Presently a gentle
voice at the open door said: “I beg your pardon, miss, but the other
gentleman thought he would like a suet pudding to-day. Would you ladies
care to ’ave one, too?”

“It sounds rather comfortable on this wet cool day,” said Gabriella
in response to Miss Cavendish’s questioning look. “If the ‘other
gentleman’ thinks it is the thing, why shouldn’t we have it?”

“Very well, we’ll have suet pudding, Mrs. Graves,” said Miss Cavendish
returning to her book.

“The other gentleman” was a mystery. He was the only other lodger in
the house, and had been seen but on two occasions: once Gabriella had
encountered him upon the stairs; once Sidney had met him as he was
coming in the front door. Miss Cavendish had never seen him and neither
of the three knew his name. Mrs. Graves never referred to him except as
“the other gentleman,” to the great amusement of the girls. That he was
a scholarly person engrossed in his books was about the only thing they
had learned about him. He always managed to leave the house after his
fellow lodgers had gone out, and came in before they did, not a very
difficult thing to do since they spent most of their time out-of-doors,
for Grasmere afforded an endless variety of delightful walks, rendered
the more interesting by their association with the Wordsworths.

“Isn’t she a dear?” said Gabriella when Mrs. Graves had softly closed
the door. “I’d like to take ’er ’ome with me. Isn’t it perfectly lovely
the way she always says ‘the other gentleman?’”

“I am quite curious to see that individual,” remarked Miss Cavendish.
“What does he look like, Gabriella?”

“Oh, he’s rather nondescript, neither old nor young; not very tall, not
very short; wears glasses, stoops a little; has a good, kind face I
think, but hasn’t a particle of curiosity, as I well realize. He wears
a disreputable old rain-streaked overcoat and a cap. To my mind he
looks as if he needed a wife.”

Miss Cavendish laughed. “I fancy he is some old Oxford professor, who
has no thought above dry-as-dust books and parchments.”

“He looks it,” returned Gabriella. “I’m afraid it is going to be too
wet for that climb up Helm Crag, although the clouds are breaking a
little over Silver How, but, even if it does clear, it will be slippy
for climbing.”

“Perhaps it will not be too wet for Loughrigg Terrace, or at all events
for Rydal Water by the lower road.”

“Radical Reform you mean. I do like Dr. Arnold’s facetious names for
the three roads. Yes, we might go to Rydal even in the rain. Rydal
Water is lovely under any circumstances; it is even just a little bit
lovelier than Grasmere, though I acknowledge it grudgingly.”

By noon the sun was shining. “In the woodsy roads we may find it damp,”
said Miss Cavendish, “though I, for one, shall not be afraid to try
the Borrowdale road, turning off before you come to the place where
we climb Helm Crag. There is a little white farmhouse somewhere along
there where we may be able to get tea.”

They took their way through the pretty green village with its scattered
houses surrounded by gardens, past the old church and up the Easedale
road over which “the lion and the lamb” and “the ancient woman beside
her rifted cell” keep watch from the heights of Helm Crag. Verdant
pastures stretched to their right, and through these the babbling
little Easedale beck chattered “over stony ways in little sharps and
trebles,” while beyond the hills arose in purple and orange splendor,
for the bracken had already turned to a gorgeous yellow and showed
in patches upon the mountain-side. Once in a while, from some rocky
platform above them, the plaintive bleat of a mountain sheep came to
their ears. The wild birds flew around the lonely heights with strange
cries. The rain had washed everything clean, but the excellent road
showed little effect of the showers except that there was no dust.

Miss Cavendish carried a small red book which she had bought the day
before. Once in a while she referred to it, and when they sat down upon
one of the benches provided for the wayfarer, she would read snatches
aloud.

Their walk finally brought them to the white cottage set in a garden
where masses of late blossoms showed freshly fair after the rain. They
were ushered into a low raftered room which delighted Gabriella’s
artistic soul, and here they were served fragrant tea with thick cream,
thin slices of bread and butter, home-made jam and plum cake.

“Isn’t it all perfectly delicious?” exclaimed Gabriella. “I’d like to
transport the whole place to America; those lovely old beams darkened
by time, this quaint table, that row of shining brass candlesticks and
the little maid herself. Fancy making such a discovery at home. Who
could drop into a casual farmhouse and be served all this so daintily,
so exquisitely, and pay only sixpence for it?”

“Gabriella, it is well that you are soon going home or you would become
an Anglomaniac,” declared Miss Cavendish.

“I am afraid I should.”

“Yes, I notice that you vaunt your country less than you did in Paris,”
said Sidney, “though seriously, this tea is remarkably good with the
fresh cream.”

“So is the bread and butter.”

“So is the plum cake, and also, so are our appetites,” this last from
Gabriella who helped herself to a second slice of cake.

They left the low-ceiled cottage, refreshed, and passed out between
rows of scarlet and gold blossoms, then took the road again. Half
way home they saw some one coming toward them, the visor of his cap
pulled down over his eyes, and his attention riveted on the book he was
striving to read as he stumbled along. “It’s ‘the other gentleman,’”
whispered Gabriella, nudging Miss Cavendish. The man passed on, but as
Gabriella turned to speak to her companion she saw that she was deadly
pale, and that she had dropped down upon a rock beside the way. “Gem
dear, are you ill? Have you sprained your ankle? What is the matter?”
asked the girl in alarm.

“It is John Price,” answered Miss Cavendish faintly.

Gabriella looked back to where Sidney was gathering a few late wild
flowers. The man’s figure was disappearing around a bend in the road.
Gabriella sat down by her friend’s side and put her arm around her.
“Oh, Gem,” she whispered, “did it mean anything to you after all these
years?”

“It was a surprise; that was all,” returned Miss Cavendish, regaining
her composure and rising to her feet. She walked on and Gabriella
waited for Sidney, the two overtaking Miss Cavendish a little further
ahead. She smiled as she saw them approaching. “I had a scare, Sidney.
Did Gabriella tell you that I saw a ghost?” she said lightly. “I think
now that perhaps I was mistaken. Ten years may make a great difference
in one’s looks and I may have forgotten. It does not seem possible that
I should meet one whom I once knew so well in this quiet little corner
of the world. Resemblances are sometimes startling and I am convinced
that I was mistaken. Come, shall we go over Butterlip How and across by
the Swan inn? It will take us home by another way.”

They continued their walk, crossing Goody Bridge and turning aside
before they reached the town. But when they came again to the highroad
they met “the other gentleman” a second time face to face. This
time the book was in his pocket. He looked up. The expression of
indifference upon his face grew into one of surprise, then to one of
pleasure. He sprang forward and held out his hand. “Isabel Cavendish!
Isabel, it can’t be you,” he exclaimed.

“It is I, John,” she answered simply.

“And these are?” he turned to the girls.

“My two goddaughters who are travelling with me.” She presented them.
The girls meekly fell behind while the older two walked on.

“Isn’t it a coincidence?” said Gabriella. “Do you suppose anything will
happen, Sid?”

“What could happen?”

“The same thing that might come about if you were not to see your
girlhood’s lover for ten years and were to meet him just here.”

“Dear me.”

“I confess to feeling absurdly jealous. I am in a rage,” declared
Gabriella. “Oh, you old blundering nose-in-a-book, she is far too good
for the likes of you. I hope your suet pudding will choke you.” She
shook her fist at the back of Mr. Price’s weather-stained coat.

“There’s no getting away from him, you see,” said Sidney, “for he
lives just across the hallway and can’t stay at home on account of the
weather.”

“If he has any sort of consideration for us he will move right away.”

This Mr. Price did not do, but from this time on he was no longer “the
other gentleman” to them, for his books were neglected, his old coat
was disdained. He appeared in a bran-new mackintosh on rainy days, and
on sunny ones in as correct a costume as even Gabriella’s fastidious
eyes could approve. He climbed the hills with them to little Easedale
tarn where they had tea in a tiny lonely hut. He had them for a drive
to Ambleside, a sail on Lake Windermere. He helped them uphill and
followed them down dale for the week longer that they remained under
Mrs. Graves’s roof, and while the girls grew to like him better and
better “the light that never was on land or sea” added a new beauty to
the face of Isabel Cavendish.

“And I suppose,” said Gabriella ruefully to her godmother, “you will be
wearing that lace bertha before long.”

“We must make up for lost time, dearie. He has waited for me for ten
long years,” returned Miss Cavendish quietly. And Gabriella, who was
experiencing some of the pangs of “hope deferred,” threw her arms
around her friend and hugged her close.

“But as I am never going to marry,” she said, “all my plans are nipped
in the bud. I was going to have it that you and mamma and I would live
together for the rest of our days in some sweet little countrylike
place which we could make as English as possible.”

“It is what we shall do, Rella, and you shall spend weeks with me.”

“Not when there is a horrid man who will carry you off for dry
discussions about things I can’t possibly understand. If he were
a business man one could hope not to see too much of him, but a
professor, and of Greek at that. No, Gem, much as I love you I cannot
feel happy at the prospect.” Then seeing that Miss Cavendish looked a
trifle hurt she called herself a beast and declared that John Price was
the very nicest man in the world and that she had but one objection
to him, and that was that he had superseded her small self in Miss
Cavendish’s affections, a statement which Miss Cavendish denied, saying
that each had a select and distinct place, after which Gabriella went
to talk with Sidney about their bridesmaid frocks.

Mr. Price would need to take an earlier sailing than the others, as his
college demanded his presence by the first of October, so the three
lingered a few days longer in the sweet vale of Grasmere to take a
last cup of tea at the white cottage, to walk once more over Loughrigg
Terrace, to make one more round of Grasmere lake and Rydal Water. Then,
one October morning, when the mists were rolling down from Helm Crag
and Silver How, they bade adieu to the spot where they had all been
very happy, and where had come to Isabella Cavendish the crowning joy
of her journey.

“You have had heartache all these years and now you are perfectly
happy,” said Gabriella wistfully, “but I am putting the ocean between
me and my hope.”

“So I thought I had done, and I have not had heartache all these years,
dear child. My life has been very full, and you, sweetheart, have
helped to fill it. Will you stay over, Gabriella? It is not too late.
Miss Bailey said that if you should change your mind at the last moment
you had but to let her know.”

But Gabriella shook her head. “I couldn’t disappoint my mother, and it
is too late anyhow.”

Yet there was a glad look in the eyes of all three as they turned
their faces toward Liverpool. Soon the ocean would no longer roll
between those whom they had left behind, and who so ardently longed
to see them. Only Miss Cavendish looked back as one who is not saying
a long farewell. “We shall come over again next year,” she murmured,
and Gabriella knew that the pronoun did not include her. She gazed
wistfully out the window as lake and mountain and green pastures faded
from their sight, and the lovely lake district gave place to chimneyed
factories and smoky towns on the way to Liverpool.

Another day saw them on the deck of a huge ocean steamer. They idly
watched till the last trunk was on board, till the hoarse whistle
announced the fact that the hour for departure had come, then they
turned away and went to look for steamer letters. In consequence of
this they were too late to see a young man rush up the gangway at the
very last moment. In one hand he carried a suit case and in the other
a great bunch of roses. He was barely in time; another minute and the
great paddle wheels began to turn. They were off.

Gabriella in her stateroom, with a little catch at her heart, was
reading Miss Bailey’s farewell letter. “We are looking every day for
Mr. Morgan,” she wrote. “He has been to some out-of-the-way place in
Germany, but is coming back to England, and you, too, my dear, will
some day come back to us, I am sure.”

There was a tap at the door of the adjoining room and presently
Gabriella looked up to see Sidney holding out a bunch of
saffron-colored roses and a letter. “The steward just brought these,”
she said. “Oh, Rella, they remind me of Italy. Who could have sent
them?”

Gabriella buried her hot face in the cool fragrant flowers, and then
she took the letter. She gave a half startled look at Sidney before she
read: “I have just learned from my dear old friends that you are to
sail to-morrow. I have learned other things, too, which give me courage
to try to reach Liverpool in time for your steamer. If I may cross
the ocean and ask your mother for the dearest girl in the world, will
you wear one of these roses down to dinner? But if my presence will
trouble you, and you would rather that we should not meet, do not wear
the rose, and I will leave the steamer at Queenstown.”

The notes of the bugle call for dinner sounded along the corridor.
Gabriella drew from the roses in her lap one perfect bud, which she
pinned to her gown. Then she turned and held out a hand to each of her
two comrades. “Come,” she said. “He is here, and I, too, shall come
back some day.”

provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
