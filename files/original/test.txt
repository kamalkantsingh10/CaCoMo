Correctly speaking, she was not an aunt at all. Because the
Maxwells’ house was at one time too large for them, she had come as
a paying-guest during a financial slump. And Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell
encouraged “Aunt Lavvy” among the children, as it covered the weekly
payment of two guineas with a soft slither of sentiment, and created
a legend in the eyes of the world--the Buckler’s Cross world. Later
on, when the financial slump was over, and the Maxwells’ house was too
small for them, Aunt Lavvy remained on in the best bedroom--by dint
of increasing pressure in the rest of the house--because to evict her
would have destroyed the aunt legend, and clearly revealed the former
reason of her being. Besides, she was already a tradition: “What should
we do without Aunt Lavvy?” Everybody took their little confidences to
Aunt Lavvy--except, perhaps, Mrs. Maxwell. Mrs. Maxwell had rather a
reddish face, and a haggard neck, and a very loud bustling voice. No,
she did not take her little confidences to Aunt Lavvy. But they got on
very well together. They had known each other as girls.
